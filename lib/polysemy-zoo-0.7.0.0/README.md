## Overview

The `polysemy-zoo` is an experimental repository for user-contributed additions
to the `polysemy` ecosystem. You're encouraged to open Pull Requests here for
any effects/interpretations that you write and think might be useful for others.

Particularly successful contributions here will be migrated into either
`polysemy` proper, or `polysemy-contrib` (the less experimental version of the
zoo.)
