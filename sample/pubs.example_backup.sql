Additionally, this allele increased the suppressor efficiency of SRM2-2, a weak tRNAGln ochre suppressor, indicating that the allosuppressor phenotype is not SUQ5-specific. A sup + sal4-2 strain also showed a temperature-dependent omnipotent suppressor phenotype, enhancing readthrough of all three termination codons. Combining the sal4-2 allele with an efficient tRNA nonsense suppressor (SUP4) increased the temperature-sensitivity of that strain, indicating that enhanced nonsense suppressor levels contribute to the conditional-lethality conferred by the sal4-2 allele.

The gallium oxide nanoparticles were prepared from mixtures of gallium nitrate aqueous solution and ammonia solution that were heated to between 600 and 800 Â°C. Addition of a proportional amount of ammonia into the solution is a key point for production of well-dispersed nano-sized gallium oxide particles.

The ability of Sup45p C-terminally tagged with (His)6 to specifically precipitate Sup35p from a cell lysate was used to confirm this interaction in vitro. Although overexpression of either the SUP45 or SUP35 genes alone did not reduce the efficiency of codon-specific tRNA nonsense suppression, the simultaneous overexpression of both the SUP35 and SUP45 genes in nonsense suppressor tRNA-containing strains produced an antisuppressor phenotype. These data are consistent with Sup35p and Sup45p forming a complex with release factor properties. Furthermore, overexpression of either Xenopus or human eRF1 (SUP45) genes also resulted in anti-suppression only if that strain was also overexpressing the yeast SUP35 gene. Antisuppression is a characteristic phenotype associated with overexpression of both prokaryote and mitochondrial release factors.

A part of our dataset consists of high resolution spectra of HC14N taken at 88.6 GHz as well as spectra of HC15N recorded at 258.16 GHz. From a thorough analysis of both lines and with the help of appropriate radiative transfer calculations we show that the isotopic ratio 15N/14N is strongly enhanced compared to the terrestrial value. We propose that the range 3.9-4.5 should be considered as a basis for the enrichment factor. Five individual lines of HC3N were measured at 39-kHz resolution using a frequency-switched technique. Several CH3CN features were recorded at 78-kHz resolution in two transitions around 147.6 and 220.7 GHz. The high spectral resolution and the good signal-to-noise ratio affecting the spectra permit us to retrieve disk-averaged vertical profiles for HCN up to 450 km and for HC3N and CH3CN up to 500 km. Comparison of our inferred vertical profiles with relevant results of presently published photochemical models is presented. We show that the profiles of HCN and HC3N predicted by various authors below 450-km altitude appear inconsistent with our new observations. We find that the three distributions present very different gradients of abundance below 200-km altitude down to the condensation levels around 80 km. In the upper stratosphere HC3N and CH3CN have approximately the same mixing ratio of about 4Ã—10-8 at 450 km, at least one order of magnitude lower than that of HCN. In the same time, another nitrile HC5N has been searched for by observing four transitions located between 109 and 221 GHz. As no spectral features could be detected after several hours of integration time, we propose an upper limit for the mixing ratio equal to 4Ã—10-10 assuming a uniform distribution of this compound in the lower stratosphere.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','0019-1035','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1006/icar.2002.6897','','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WGF-46C6GBJ-M/2/c4124322b489c20a0c6dd7ea589fc580','FMIPA-ITB @ alfan_103 @ marten_new_2002','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',101,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','11:31:10','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','12:18:10','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)',1),('Juliawaty, L.D.; Kitajima, M.; Takayama, H.; Achmad, S.A.; Aimi, N.','','','Juliawaty, LD',3,'A 6-substituted-5,6-dihydro-2-pyrone from Cryptocarya strictifolia','','Phytochemistry','',2000,'54',54,'8','989-993',989,'Cryptocarya strictifolia; Lauraceae; 6-Substituted-5,6-dihydro-2-pyrone; Strictifolione; Absolute configuration; Pinocembrin; Lysicamine','',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','0031-9422','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'','','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6TH7-4177HCD-1R/2/8d662a7bdbb66a429eb03272a86df3b8','FMIPA-ITB @ sulaeman @ Juliawaty2000989','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',102,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','13:21:37','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','13:21:37','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)',1),('Juliawaty, L.D.; Watanabe, Y.; Kitajima, M.; Achmad, S.A.; Takayama, H.; Aimi, N.','','','Juliawaty, LD',3,'First total synthesis and determination of the absolute configuration of strictifolione, a new 6-([omega]-phenylalkenyl)-5,6-dihydro-[alpha]-pyrone, isolated from Cryptocarya strictifolia','','Tetrahedron Letters','',2002,'43',43,'48','8657-8660',8657,'Cryptocarya; [alpha]-pyrone; chiral total synthesis; absolute configuration','',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','0040-4039','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'','','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6THS-4741XM6-B/2/91debf7e88723187df724cd5f74a6f6e','FMIPA-ITB @ sulaeman @ Juliawaty20028657','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',103,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','13:22:27','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','13:22:27','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)',1),('Syah, Y.M.; Achmad, S.A.; Ghisalberti, E.L.; Hakim, E.H.; Makmur, L.; Mujahidin, D.','','','Syah, YM',3,'Artoindonesianins G-I, three new isoprenylated flavones from Artocarpus lanceifolius','','Fitoterapia','',2001,'72',72,'7','765-773',765,'Artocarpus lanceifolius; Artoindonesianins G-I; Flavones; Cytotoxicity','',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','0367-326X','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'','','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VSC-447CXTY-8/2/01d0db2453d8be0b4d6a487b584a8aa5','FMIPA-ITB @ sulaeman @ Syah2001765','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',104,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','13:49:36','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','13:49:36','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)',1),('Marten, A.; Matthews, H.E.; Owen, T.; Moreno, R.; Hidayat, T.; Biraud, Y.',NULL,NULL,'Marten, A',3,'Improved constraints on Neptuneâ€™s atmosphere from submillimetre-wavelength observations',NULL,'Astronomy and Astrophysics',NULL,2005,'429',429,'3','9',9,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'FMIPA-ITB @ alfan_103 @ marten_improved_2005','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,105,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','13:58:56','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','13:58:56','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)',1),('Moreno, R.; Marten, A.; Hidayat, T.',NULL,NULL,'Moreno, R',3,'Interferometric measurements of zonal winds on Titan',NULL,'Astronomy and Astrophysics',NULL,2005,'437',437,'1','10',10,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'FMIPA-ITB @ alfan_103 @ moreno_interferometric_2005','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,106,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','13:58:56','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','13:58:56','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)',1),('Hidayat, T.; Marten, A.; BÃ©zard, B.; Gautier, D.; Owen, T.; Matthews, H.E.; Paubert, G.',NULL,NULL,'Hidayat, T',3,'Millimeter and Submillimeter Heterodyne Observations of Titan: Retrieval of the Vertical Profile of HCN and the12C/13C Ratio',NULL,'Icarus',NULL,1997,'126',126,'1','170-182',170,NULL,'We report new observations of the (1-0) line of HCN at 88.63 GHz, emitted by Titan, made in May 1995 with the IRAM 30-m radiotelescope located at Pico Veleta (Spain).

A review of spectroscopic measurements undertaken between 1995 and 1999 with the IRAM 30-m Telescope and the JCMT is presented. Our study was mainly concerned with the abundances of nitriles and oxygen-bearing compounds in the stratosphere of Titan. New results regarding HCN, HC3N, CH3CN and CO have been obtained. Observations of isotopic components, such as H13CN, HC15N and 13CO, led to the determination of the isotopic ratios 12C/13C and 14N/15N. A comparison of our abundance results with predictions of various photochemical models is outlined. A search for trace species, i.e., HC5N, C2H3CN, C2H5CN, CH3OH, H2CO, is also discussed.

The calculation results showed that 40 years reactor life time without refueling can be achieved by choosing appropriate values for the initial plutonium enrichment, fuel volume fraction, and size of each corresponding region. For this design the maximum excess reactivity can be reduced to a few percent by shifting the position of the power peak from the outer to the inner region of the core along burnup. Especially, dividing core and blanket into two regions, respectively, and adjusting parameters of each region reduced the excess reactivity during burnup to below 0.2%[Delta]k.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0029-5493',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V4D-4810YG9-17M/2/e8cf081d0e9e668ac1b560206f5d9173','FI-ITB @ dede @ suud_preliminary_1993','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,135,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','14:37:03','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','14:37:03','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)',1),('Sugiharto,; Suâ€™ud, Z.; Kurniadi, R.; Waris, A.; Santoso, S.B.; Abidin, Z.; Santoso, G.B.',NULL,NULL,'Sugiharto,',3,'Radiotracer Dilution Method for Mercury Inventory Study in Electrolytic Cells',NULL,'AIP Conference Proceedings',NULL,2010,'1244',1244,'1','247-252',247,'beams;, density, electrolytes;, ion, measurement, radioactive',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://link.aip.org/link/?APC/1244/247/1','FI-ITB @ dede @ sugiharto_radiotracer_2010','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,136,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','14:37:03','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','14:37:03','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)',1),('Kim, S.-G.; Hagura, N.; Iskandar, F.; Okuyama, K.',NULL,NULL,'Kim, S-G',3,'Characterization of silica-coated Ag nanoparticles synthesized using a water-soluble nanoparticle micelle',NULL,'Advanced Powder Technology',NULL,2009,'20',20,'1','94-100',94,'Ag, HTAB, Micelles, NANOPARTICLES, Silica coating','This article describes the synthesis of silica-coated Ag nanoparticles using a water-soluble nanoparticle micelle under basic conditions.

The reason to divide the human population into two age classes is for practical purpose, as vaccination is usually concentrated in one age class. We assume that a constant rate of individuals in the child-class is vaccinated. We analyze a threshold number which is equivalent to the basic reproduction number. If there is an undeliberate vaccination to infectious children, which worsens their condition as the time span of being infectious increases, then paradoxically, vaccination can be counter productive. The paradox, stating that vaccination makes the basic reproduction number even bigger, can occur if the worsening effect is greater than a certain threshold, a function of the human demographic and epidemiological parameters, which is independent of the level of vaccination.

For that reason, effective and environmentally friendly methods need to be applied in Indonesian reservoirs; one of them is Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR). This method involves the knowledge of biotechnology and petroleum engineering and is aimed to improve oil recovery in old and marginal wells. This paper presents laboratory investigation of bacteria ability to live and alter crude oil physical characteristics in high-pressure condition of 250 psi and 500 psi, provided with a mathematical model for further analysis. The experiment was conducted in a special apparatus called conditioning cells, which is made of stainless steel. Data obtained from the investigation are then used to make a mathematical model and simulation for analysis and prediction. After 3-days of treatment by bacteria in high pressure condition, oil viscosity decreases by 11,27 % in 250 psi and 11,88 % in 500 psi; further investigation after 7-days showed that oil viscosity decreases by 22,48% in 250 psi and 20,70% in 500 psi. The IFT after 3-days of treatment by bacteria in high pressure condition decreases by 18,84% in 250 psi and 6,09 % in 500 psi; further investigation after 7-days showed that IFT decreases by 27,54 % in 250 psi and 9,33 % in 500 psi. The mathematical model shows that the maximum production of bacteria increases with the increase of the initial input of bacteria, and the higher the pressure is, the faster the bacteria growth is. It can be concluded that the bacteria are able to live in high pressure (piezophile bacteria) and give positive impact to the crude oil by decreasing its viscosity and reducing the IFT hence improve oil mobility. It is predicted that by applying this method Indonesia crude oil production can be improved or at least the production decrease can be slowed down.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Conference Article',NULL,NULL,'10.2118/123506-MS','','http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPE-123506-MS&soc=SPE','MA-ITB @ adedi @ halim_microbial_2009','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',159,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','14:43:43','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-29','19:27:52','Admin FMIPA Publications (admin@pubs.fmipa.itb.ac.id)',1),('Arianto; Zen, F.P.; Gunara, B.E.; Triyanta; Supardi',NULL,NULL,'Arianto',3,'Some Impacts of Lorentz Violation on Cosmology',NULL,'709.3688',NULL,2007,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'High Energy Physics - Theory','The impact of Lorentz violation on the dynamics of a scalar field is investigated. In particular, we study the dynamics of a scalar field in the scalar-vector-tensor theory where the vector field is constrained to be unity and time like. By taking a generic form of the scalar field action, a generalized dynamical equation for the scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity is obtained to describe the cosmological solutions. We present a class of exact solutions for an ordinary scalar field or phantom field corresponding to a power law coupling vector and the Hubble parameter. As the results, we find a constant equation of state in de Sitter space-time and power law expansion with the quadratic of coupling vector, while a dynamic equation of state is obtained for $n\\textgreater 2$. Then, we consider the inflationary scenario based on the Lorentz violating scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity with general power-law coupling vector and two typical potentials: inverse power-law and power-law potentials. In fact, both the coupling vector and the potential models affect the dynamics of the inflationary solutions.

The bead mill utilizes centrifugation to separate beads from nanoparticle suspensions and allows for the use of small sized beads (i.e. 15-30 [mu]m in diameter). The performance of the beads mill in dispersing a suspension of titanium dioxide nanoparticle with 15 nm primary particles was evaluated experimentally. Dynamic light scattering was used to measure titania particle size distributions over time during the milling process, and bead sizes in the 15-100 [mu]m range were used. It was found that larger beads (50-100 [mu]m) were not capable of fully dispersing nanoparticles, and particles reagglomerated after long milling times. Smaller beads (15-30 [mu]m) were capable of dispersing nanoparticles, and a sharp peak around 15 nm in the titania size distribution was visible when smaller beads were used. Because nanoparticle collisions with smaller beads have lower impact energy, it was found by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy that changes in nanoparticle crystallinity and morphology are minimized when smaller beads are used. Furthermore, inductively-coupled plasma spectroscopy was used to determine the level of bead contamination in the nanoparticle suspension during milling, and it was found that smaller beads are less likely to fragment and contaminate nanoparticle suspensions.

Cobalt palladium (CoPd) nanoparticles, hBN nanoparticles, and ethanol were used as the catalyst, matrix, and carbon source, respectively. The materials were mixed by ultrasonication and then sprayed into a vertical tubular reactor at 900 Â°C under an argon flow of 2 L/min. As the aerosol passed through the reactor, the following processes occurred sequentially: solvent evaporation; formation of spherical particles composed of hBN and CoPd nanoparticles; catalytic decomposition of ethanol; and CNT growth on the surface of the CoPd nanoparticles. As a result, spherical-hairy particles were obtained, and both the hBN hexagonal phase and primary particle diameter were maintained during the reaction pathway because of the short residence time (1 s). The results showed that the spray-dried particle size and population of MWCNTs depended on the residence time within the heating zone and on the initial CoPd concentration.

The results show that aside from emission of the host atom, the emission intensities of other ablated atoms of significantly smaller masses as well as that of the He atom generally exhibit relatively rapid initial decline with increasing crater depth. This trend was found to have its origin in the decreasing laser power density arriving at the crater bottom and thereby weakened the shock wave generated in the crater. As the crater deepened, the declining trend of the intensity appeared to level off as a result of compensation of the decreasing laser power density by the enhanced plasma confinement at increasing crater depth. Meanwhile, the result also reveals the significant contribution of the He-assisted excitation process to the doped hydrogen and deuterium emission intensities, leading to similar crater-depth dependent variation patterns in contrast to that associated with the surface water, with growing dominance of this common feature at the later stage of the plasma expansion.

Ordering of the vanadium spins at 114 K has little effect on the orbital fluctuations, but the orbital ordering becomes coherent below a first-order transition to an orthorhombic Pbnm phase at 40 K.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1103/PhysRevB.79.045101',NULL,'http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.045101','FMIPA-ITB @ admin @ blake_competition_2009','Admin FMIPA Publications (admin@pubs.fmipa.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,544,NULL,'no','2010-10-29','17:34:55','Admin FMIPA Publications (admin@pubs.fmipa.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-29','17:34:55','Admin FMIPA Publications (admin@pubs.fmipa.itb.ac.id)',1),('Siregar, S.',NULL,NULL,'Siregar, S',1,'Ecliptical orthogonal motion and perihelion distribution of the AAA asteroids',NULL,'Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia',NULL,1991,'9',9,NULL,'315',315,'AMOR ASTEROID, APOLLO ASTEROIDS, ECLIPTIC, EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS, ORBITAL MECHANICS, PERIHELIONS, SOLAR SYSTEM EVOLUTION','Not Available',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991PASAu...9..315S','AS-ITB @ ati @ siregar_ecliptical_1991','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,215,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:09:14','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','15:09:14','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Budi, D.; Nakamura, T.; Yoshida, F.; Aoki, T.; Urata, Y.',NULL,NULL,'Budi, D',3,'GRB031026 : KISO optical follow-up observation',NULL,'GRB Coordinates Network',NULL,2003,'2427',2427,NULL,'1',1,NULL,'Not Available',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003GCN..2427....1B','AS-ITB @ ati @ budi_grb031026_2003','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,218,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:09:14','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','15:09:14','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Wiryanto, L.H.','','','Wiryanto, LH',1,'Wave propagation passing over a submerged porous breakwater','','Journal of Engineering Mathematics','',2010,'',NULL,'','',NULL,'','A linear model of waves propagating over a submerged porous breakwater is derived from two coupled boundary-value problems, each of which represents the governing equation in a different medium.

To study spectral evolutions throughout a burst cycle from the onset of a burst to the next burst, we constructed six composite burst-cycles in terms of the burst fluence, and divided each of them into seven phases. We then fitted the 42 spectra with a two-component model consisting of a blackbody (BB) component expected from the boundary layer, and a multi-color-disk (MCD) component expected from the standard disk, systematically. The results show that the luminosity of the BB component is much larger than that of the MCD component during a burst, while the two luminosities become comparable during a persistent phase. They also indicate that the innermost radius of the standard disk tends to recede outwards in the burst decay. These results suggest that although the standard disk extends close to the neutron star surface during a persistent phase, another accretion flo w onto the neutron star is needed during a burst phase.

Typically the order of accuracy of the solution is increased by 2 each time that a deferred correction is applied and this allows inexpensive local error estimates to be computed using embedding. Recent research has shown how deferred correction schemes having the very desirable property of superconvergence can be derived. This marks a significant step forward in the design of deferred correction algorithms although the price to be paid for superconvergence is that it is difficult to derive realistic embedded local error estimates. In the present paper we show that Richardson extrapolation is a viable alternative for error estimation and we consider in some detail the relative merits of embedding and extrapolation. Guided by this analysis we are able to derive for the first time a Lobatto deferred correction code which is very efficient for the solution of stiff problems, particularly in cases where the MIRK code TWPBVP.f is unstable. Furthermore we are able to derive efficient interpolants for this Lobatto code which are also applicable to MIRK formulae and we consider the problem of estimating the error in these interpolants. This completely solves the interpolation problem for our deferred correction codes apart perhaps for deriving interpolants for extremely stiff problems.

As an estimation to quantify the observational data we assume the gray LTE approximation holds to the upper boundary of the atmosphere, thereby reducing the Martian atmosphere to a simple gray LTE model. The resolution limit in our data only amounts to ~ 1 second of arc, which corresponds to a linear distance of 270 km on the Martian surface.

In this study, an amino acid (e.g. lysine) was utilized to catalyze and to maintain the silica formation due to its ability in covering prepared silica after reaction.

The result showed spherical particles with controllable pore size (from 4 to 15 nm) and outer diameter (from 20 to 80 nm) was produced. The ability to control pore size and outer diameter was drastically altered by adjusting the concentration of styrene and hydrophobic molecules, respectively.

Considering the now widely accepted view that NEAs originate dynamically from the main-belt asteroids (MBAs), it is natural for us to look for fast-rotators among the sub-km MBAs. However, because of their faintness, such an attempt had been unsuccessful with telescopes of a few meters in diameter, which were in common use a decade ago. With the wide-field mosaic CCD camera (Suprime-Cam) attached to the prime focus of the 8.2 m Subaru telescope atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii, we made lightcurve observations of very small MBAs on Oct. 20, 2001. In a FOV of 34â€™ x 27â€™ covered by ten chips, we detected 127 asteroids down to R ~25 and light variations for 92 asteroids were measured. Fourier periodogram analysis brought about 5 \"certain\"-class and 20 \"likely\"-class fast-rotators with spin periods less than Tr. Their sizes range from 0.5 to 2 km. Periodic nature of those data was confirmed by reanalysis of simulated lightcurves. The main results of this study are summarized as: 1) the MBA fast-rotators discovered in this observation are about one order of magnitude larger than those among NEAs, 2) lightcurve amplitudes for our MBA fast-rotators are small compared with those for ordinary asteroids, and this finding is consistent with the result on NEA fast-rotators (Pravec and Harris 2000), and 3) fast-rotators may occupy a non-negligible fraction ( ~25/92=27%) of MBAs in our observed size range.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Conference Article',NULL,NULL,'','','http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002DPS....34.1409D','FMIPA-ITB @ alfan_103 @ dermawan_search_2002','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',301,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:12:23','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-25','11:11:57','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Dermawan, B.; Nakamura, T.; Yoshida, F.','','','Dermawan, B',3,'Spin and Shape Distributions of Small Main-belt Asteroids','','Proceeding of The 9th Asian-Pacific Regional IAU Meeting','',2006,'',NULL,'','67',67,'','Not Available',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Conference Article',NULL,NULL,'','','http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006apri.meet...67D','FMIPA-ITB @ alfan_103 @ dermawan_spin_2006','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',302,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:12:23','Alfan Nasrulloh (alfan_103@s.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-25','11:10:51','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Sekiguchi, T.; Abe, M.; Boehnhardt, H.; Dermawan, B.; Hainaut, O.R.; Hasegawa, S.',NULL,NULL,'Sekiguchi, T',3,'Thermal observations of MUSES-C mission target (25143) 1998 SF36',NULL,'Astronomy and Astrophysics',NULL,2003,'397',397,NULL,'325-328',325,'asteroids, infrared: solar system, minor planets, space vehicles','We present thermal observations of MUSES-C mission target, (25143) 1998 SF36.

This algorithm computes the trajectories of light rays between the observer, located at redshift z = 0, and distant sources located at high redshift using the multiple lens plane method. The deformation and deflection of light beams as they interact with each lens plane are computed using the filled-beam approximation. We use a particle-particle/particle-mesh (P3M) N-body numerical code to simulate the formation of large-scale structure in the universe. We extend the length resolution of the simulations to submegaparsec scales by using a Monte Carlo method for locating galaxies inside the computational volume according to the underlying distribution of background matter. The observed galaxy two-point correlation function is reproduced. This algorithm constitutes a major improvement over previous methods, which either neglected the presence of large-scale structure, neglected the presence of galaxies, neglected the contribution of distant matter (matter located far from the beam), or used the Zeldovich approximation for simulating the formation of large-scale structure. In addition, we take into account the observed morphology-density relation when assigning morphological types to galaxies, something that was ignored in all previous studies. To test this algorithm, we perform 1981 simulations for three different cosmological models: an Einstein-de Sitter model with density parameter Omega 0 = 1, an open model with Omega 0 = 0.2, and a flat, low-density model with Omega 0 = 0.2 and a cosmological constant of lambda 0 = 0.8. In all models, the initial density fluctuations correspond to a cold dark matter power spectrum normalized to COBE. In each simulation, we compute the shear and magnification resulting from the presence of inhomogeneities. Our results are the following: (1) The magnification is totally dominated by the convergence, with the shear contributing less than one part in 104. (2) Most of the cumulative shear and magnification is contributed by matter located at intermediate redshifts, z = 1-2. (3) The actual value of the redshift at which the largest contribution to shear and magnification occurs depends on the cosmological model. In particular, the lens planes contributing the most are located at larger redshift for models with smaller Omega 0. (4) The number of galaxies directly hit by the beam increases with redshift, while the contribution of lens planes to the shear and magnification decrease with increasing lens plane redshift for z \\textgreater 2, which indicates that the bulk of the shear and magnification does not originate from direct hits, but rather from the tidal influence of nearby and more distant galaxies and background matter. (5) The average contributions of background matter and nearby galaxies to the shear is comparable for models with small Omega 0. For the Einstein-de Sitter model, the contribution of the background matter exceeds the contribution of nearby galaxies by nearly 1 order of magnitude.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'','','http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/493/1/10','AS-ITB @ evan @ premadi_light_1998-1','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',317,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:12:59','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-28','11:51:28','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Premadi, P.; Martel, H.; Matzner, R.; Futamase, T.',NULL,NULL,'Premadi, P',3,'Light Propagation in Inhomogeneous Universes.

This is the largest cosmological parameter survey ever undertaken in this field. We performed a total of 3798 experiments, each experiment consisting of propagating a square beam of angular size 21.9\"Ã—21.9\" composed of 116,281 light rays from the observer up to redshift z=3. These experiments provide statistics of the magnification, shear, and multiple imaging of distant sources. The results of these experiments can be compared with observations and eventually help to constrain the possible values of the cosmological parameters. In addition, they provide insight into the gravitational lensing process and its complex relationship with the various cosmological parameters. Our main results are the following: (1) The magnification distribution depends mostly upon Î»0 and Ïƒ8. As Ïƒ8 increases, the low tail of the magnification distribution shifts toward lower magnifications, while the high tail is hardly affected. The magnification distribution also becomes wider as Î»0 increases. This effect is particularly large for models with Î»0=0.8. (2) The magnification probability Pm is almost independent of Ïƒ8, for any combination of Î©0, Î»0, and H0, indicating that Pm does not depend strongly upon the amount of large-scale structure. (3) The shear distribution, like the magnification distribution, depends mostly upon Î»0 and Ïƒ8. The shear distribution becomes wider with increasing Ïƒ8 and increasing Î»0. The similarities between the properties of the magnification and shear distributions suggest that both phenomena are caused by weak lensing. (4) About 0.3% of sources have multiple images. The double-image probability P2 increases strongly with Î»0 and is independent of Î©0, H0, and Ïƒ8. (5) The distribution of image separations depends strongly upon Î»0 and is independent of Ïƒ8. Summarizing these results, we find that (a) The properties of gravitational lensing, both weak and strong, depend much more strongly upon Î»0 than any other cosmological parameter, and (b) magnification and shear are examples of weak lensing caused primarily by the distribution of background matter, with negligible contribution from galaxies, while multiple images and rings are examples of strong lensing, caused by direct interaction with galaxies, with negligible contribution from the background matter. Observations of weak lensing can be used to determine the cosmological constant and the density structure of the universe, while observations of strong lensing can be used to determine the cosmological constant and the internal structure of galaxies and clusters. Gravitational lensing depends much more weakly upon Î©0 and H0 than Ïƒ8 and Î»0, making a determination of these parameters from observations more difficult.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJS..135....7P','AS-ITB @ evan @ premadi_light_2001','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,318,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:12:59','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','15:12:59','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Martel, H.; Premadi, P.; Matzner, R.',NULL,NULL,'Martel, H',3,'Light Propagation in Inhomogeneous Universes.

Our model assumes that multiple imaging results from strong lensing by individual galaxies. We model galaxies as nonsingular isothermal spheres, whose parameters are functions of the luminosity and morphological type, and take into account the finite angular size of the sources. Our model neglects the contribution of the background matter distribution to lensing and assumes that lensing is entirely caused by galaxies. To test the validity of this assumption, we performed a series of ray-tracing experiments to study the effect of the background matter on the distribution of image separations. Our results are the following: (1) The presence of the background matter tends to increase the image separations produced by lensing galaxies, making the distributions of image separations wider. However, this effect is rather small and independent of the cosmological model. (2) Simulations with galaxies and background matter often produce a secondary peak in the distribution of image separations at large separations. This peak does not appear when the background matter is excluded from the simulations. (3) The effect of the background matter on the magnification distribution is negligible in low-density universes (Î©0=0.2) with small density contrast (Ïƒ8=0.4), but becomes very important as Î©0 and Ïƒ8 increase, resulting in a significant widening of the distribution. (4) Multiple imaging is caused primarily by early-type galaxies (elliptical and S0), with a negligible contribution from spiral galaxies. (5) Our analytical model, which has only two free parameters, is in good agreement with the results of ray-tracing experiments, successfully reproducing the distributions of image separations, and also the multiple-imaging probability, for all cosmological models considered. (6) The analytical model predicts that the distributions of image separations are virtually indistinguishable for flat, cosmological-constant models with different values of Î©0. (7) For models with no cosmological constant, the distributions of image separations do depend upon Î©0, but this dependence is weak. We conclude that while the number of multiple-imaged sources can put strong constraints on the cosmological parameters, the distribution of image separations does not constrain the cosmological models in any significant way and mostly provides constraints on the structure of the galaxies responsible for lensing.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...570...17M','AS-ITB @ evan @ martel_light_2002','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,319,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:12:59','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','15:12:59','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Premadi, P.; Martel, H.',NULL,NULL,'Premadi, P',2,'Light Propagation in Inhomogeneous Universes.

The background matter increases the magnification by a few percent at most, while nearby galaxies can increase it by up to about 10%. The effect on the image separation is even smaller. The only significant effect results from the random alignment of physically unassociated galaxies, which can increase the magnification by factors of several, create additional images, and turn arcs into rings.

The calculations start at z = 24 and end at z = 0. We use the results of these simulations to generate distributions of galaxies at the present (z = 0), as follows: Using a Monte Carlo method based on the present distribution of dark matter, we located ~40,000 galaxies in the computational volume. We then ascribe to each galaxy a morphological type based on the local number density of galaxies in order to reproduce the observed morphology-density relation. The resulting galaxy distributions are similar to the observed ones, with most ellipticals concentrated in the densest regions, and most spirals concentrated in low-density regions. By \"tying\" each galaxy to its nearest dark matter particle, we can trace the trajectory of that galaxy back in time by simply looking at the location of that dark matter particle at earlier time slices provided by the N-body code. This enables us to reconstruct the distribution of galaxies at high redshift and the trajectory of each galaxy from its formation epoch to the present. We use these galaxy distributions to investigate the problem of morphological evolution. Our goal is to determine whether the morphological type of galaxies is determined primarily by the initial conditions in which these galaxies form or by evolutionary processes (such as mergers or tidal stripping) occurring after the galaxies have formed and eventually altering their morphology, or a combination of both effects. Our main technique consists of comparing the environments in which galaxies are at the epoch of galaxy formation (taken to be at redshift z = 3) with the environment in which the same galaxies are at the present. Making the null hypothesis that the morphological types of galaxies do not evolve, we compare the galaxies that form in low-density environments but end up later in high-density environments to the ones that also form in low-density environments but remain in low-density environments. The first group contains a larger proportion of elliptical and S0 galaxies than the second group. We assume that the initial galaxy formation process cannot distinguish a low-density environment that will always remain low density from one that will eventually become high density. Therefore, these results are absurd and force us to discard the null hypothesis that morphological evolution does not occur. Our study suggests that ~75% of the elliptical and S0 galaxies observed at present formed as such, while the remaining ~25% of these galaxies formed as spiral galaxies and underwent morphological evolution for all three cosmological models considered (the percentages might be smaller for elliptical than for S0 galaxies). These numbers assume a morphological evolution process that converts one spiral galaxy into either a S0 or an elliptical galaxy. If the morphological evolution process involves mergers of spiral galaxies, these numbers be would closer to 85% and 15%, respectively. We conclude that most galaxies did not undergo morphological evolution, but a nonnegligible fraction did.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...497..512M','AS-ITB @ evan @ martel_morphological_1998','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,324,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:12:59','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-23','15:12:59','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Ogi, T.; Hidayat, D.; Iskandar, F.; Purwanto, A.; Okuyama, K.',NULL,NULL,'Ogi, T',3,'Direct synthesis of highly crystalline transparent conducting oxide nanoparticles by low pressure spray pyrolysis',NULL,'Advanced Powder Technology',NULL,2009,'20',20,'2','203-209',203,'Electrical properties, Low-pressure spray pyrolysis, Single-crystal, Single-step, Transparent conducting oxide','In this article, we firstly reported a general preparation method for the production of highly crystallized and single crystalline transparent conducting oxide (TCO) nanoparticles: tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), zinc-doped indium oxide (IZO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), and gallium-doped zinc oxide (GZO).

As an important part of our work, we complement our study of SFR vs. density with a study of SFR vs. colour, where colour is expected to represent galaxy type. The colours of the galaxy are taken in u-g and g-r, and we use Strateva et al (2001) scheme to identify the galaxies as either early type or late type. We then plot the SFR against u-r colour to see the dependence of SFR on colour.

Upgrenâ€™s (1962,1963) data for F and gK stars in the direction of NGP; Bok & Basinski (1964) for F stars and McNeill (1989) for gK in the SGP have been used to redetermine the stellar density distribution perpendicular to the galactic plane. Recent determination of absolute magnitude of F stars (Houk et al., 1997); gK (Creze et al., 1989) and the absorption law by Knude (1996) is incorporated in the calculation. Exponential density distribution is assumed to represent the distribution up z=300 pc for F stars; z=500 pc for gK stars. There is an apparent asymmetric z distribution of these stars. This is interpreted as the sign of off-galactic plane position of the sun. Our calculation suggests that the sun is at z= 30-45 pc if F stars is used. Yamagata & Yoshi (1992) obtained z=40 pc based on the halo red stars. However, the sunâ€™s position is found at lower z (15-20 pc) if gK stars distribution is used. Combined Boltzmann-Poisson equation are solved analytically to find the total mass density (see Pham, 1997). Using the derived space-density and z-velocity-dispersion data obtained by Gomez et al. (1990) for F, by Flynn & Fuchs (1994) for gK, we obtained the total mass density of 0.150 and 0.115 Mo/pc3, respectively from F and gK. The value is checked against galaxy model and procedure of Bahcall (1984). Total mass density of 0.210 and 0.205 Mo/pc3 are derived from F and gK stars distributions respectively. Phamâ€™s method gives systematically lower total mass density as compared with that obtained by using Bahcall method. We note that the revised Phamâ€™s method is closer to the value of Oort limit. Taken this as face value we incline to propose that there is no missing mass; similar to that obtained by Pham (1997) based on Hipparcos F stars.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Conference Article',NULL,NULL,'','','http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AAS...19312302A','AS-ITB @ evan @ arifyanto_mass_1999','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',336,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:13:17','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-25','10:57:32','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Arifyanto, M.I.; Fuchs, B.','','','Arifyanto, MI',2,'Quantitative Interpretation of Rotation Curve of NGC 2985','','Astronomische Gesellschaft Abstract Series','',2001,'18',18,'','215',215,'','We discuss the decomposition of the rotation curve of NGC 2985 into the various contributions by its components such as bulge, disk, and dark halo.

Activities related both to education and research conducted using this reflector since its installation comprise of scientific (photometry, spectroscopy, imagery) and experiment in instrumentation (fiber-fed spectrograph, CCD camera insitu testing). An important side result of the photometric observations is atmospheric study based on long-term atmospheric extionction coefficients.

The star is hot and hydrogen-deficient, similar to the pre-white-dwarf PG 1159 stars. NGC1501 shows pulsational brightness variations of a few percent with periods ranging from 19 to 87 minutes. The variations are very complex, suggesting a pulsation spectrum that requires a long unbroken time series to resolve. Our CCD photometry of the star covers a two-week period in 1991 November, and used a global network of observatories. We obtained nearly continuous coverage over an interval of one week in the middle of the run. We have identified 10 pulsation periods, ranging from 5235 s down to 1154 s. We find strong evidence that the modes are indeed nonradial g-modes. The ratios of the frequencies of the largest-amplitude modes agree with those expected for modes that are trapped by a density discontinuity in the outer layers. We offer a model for the pulsation spectrum that includes a common period spacing of 22.3 s and a rotation period of 1.17 days; the period spacing allows us to assign a seismological mass of 0.55+/-0.03 Msun.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1086/118214','','http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9609024','AS-ITB @ evan @ bond_asteroseismological_1996','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',370,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:14:09','Evan Akbar (evan@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-26','15:08:37','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Kuncarayakti, H.;

This system has already passed periastron three times since observed in the end of year 1876. The observation data is more than enough to construct an orbit. By using Thiele-Innes method we computed the orbit, and physical parameters are determined by using mass-luminosity relation. The result is presented in the table.

Cumulative number distributions of flare event time-integrated energies are solved by a least-squares method on log-log plot for a power-law function to obtain both the constant alpha and the gradient beta, which are found to be similar among the three stars. The gradient showed that rare large flare events radiate most of the energy released by all the flare events in the monitoring time. The flare number rate and energy are found to be similar if the power-law distributions are extended up to a specific maximum energy. In reality, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the observed cumulative number distributions of flare event energy were not necessarily a power-law function.

Data from UBV photometric and high-dispersion spectroscopic studies conducted between 1984 and 1989 are analyzed by means of a light curve and radial velocity studies. The radial velocity studies show that a single-lined binary with a period of 1.7545 days comprises the inner system. Further analysis reveals that it is an evolved G-type star with an active chromosphere. The G star has a low-mass companion, and the third body is a hot subdwarf that excites the surrounding planetary nebula. A change in the observed systemic velocities with a period of approximately 2000 days points toward the existence of the third body.

The resulted relations of the system parameters and the pertinent physical quantities reveal an interesting algebraic structure and symmetry properties containing the previous results as special cases, with higher degrees of symmetry corresponding to more specific restrictions of the parameters. Detailed analysis of the associated parameter space exhibits clearly delineated regions for the different species of spatial solitons with wide ranging variations of characteristics as functions of the parameters. A practical working scheme is then formulated for tailoring the soliton characteristics according to a relatively simple rule. This is exemplified by a specific choice of soliton characteristics supported by a realistic set of system parameters in connection with the study of the dynamical process of soliton propagation in the system. A further study conducted on the dynamics of linear superpositions of two exact bright soliton pairs shows similar relative-phase dependent, attractive, and repulsive interactions as observed in a homogeneous medium while exhibiting visible envelope broadening due to the diffraction effect. The diffraction effect is shown to result in a wobbling phenomenon for the case of two bright solitons with asymmetric amplitudes. In the case of wide-stripe dark solitons, the propagation features a rapid split-off into several narrow stripes, and the number of new stripes depends proportionally on the width of the initial stripes as well as the ratio between its forward and backward amplitudes.

Uranium and plutonium have been used for â€œnew fuelâ€ resources from LWR spent fuel as MOX fuel type which is loaded into thermal reactor or fast reactor types. Other actinides from the spent fuel such as neptunium, americium and curium as minor actinide (MA) are considered to be loaded into the reactors for specific purposes, recently. Those purposes such as for increasing protected plutonium production and breeding capability for protected plutonium as well as in the same time those amount of MA can be reduced to a small quantity as a burner or transmutation purpose. Some investigations and scientific approaches are performed in order to increase a material â€œbarrierâ€ in plutonium isotope composition by increasing the even mass number of plutonium isotope such as Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242 as plutonium protected composition. Higher material barrier which related to intrinsic properties of plutonium isotopes with even mass number (Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242), are recognized because of their intense decay heat (DH) and high spontaneous fission neutron (SFN) rates. Those even number mass of plutonium isotope contribute to some criteria of plutonium characterization which will be adopted for present study such as IAEA, Pellaud and Kessler criteria (IAEA, 1972; Pellaud, 2002; and Kessler, 2007). The present paper intends to evaluate the breeding capability as a fuel sustainability index of the reactors and to analyze the composition of protected plutonium production of large power reactor based on the FaCT FBR as reference (Ohki, et al., 2008).

The thermochemistry and rate parameters of a number of key reactions have been obtained by ab initio calculations carried out at CASSCF, CASPT2, and G2(MP2) levels of theory. Several reaction pathways were investigated. The major product, HCN, arises principally from a hydrogen migration in pyrrole to form a cyclic carbene with the NH bond intact. Ring scission of this carbene leads to an allenic imine precursor of HCN and propyne. This is the decomposition pathway of lowest energy. Pyrolysis is preceded by the facile tautomerization of pyrrole to 2H-pyrrolenine. The latter can undergo CN fission to form an open chain biradical species, which is the precursor of the butenenitrile isomeric products, cis- and trans-crotononitrile and allyl cyanide. The biradical can also undergo facile H-fission to form cyanoallyl radical, which is an important precursor of acetylene, acetonitrile, and acrylonitrile.

This algorithm computes the trajectories of light rays between the observer, located at redshift z = 0, and distant sources located at high redshift using the multiple lens plane method. The deformation and deflection of light beams as they interact with each lens plane are computed using the filled-beam approximation.\r\n\r\n    We use a particle-particle/particle-mesh (P3M) N-body numerical code to simulate the formation of large-scale structure in the universe. We extend the length resolution of the simulations to submegaparsec scales by using a Monte Carlo method for locating galaxies inside the computational volume according to the underlying distribution of background matter. The observed galaxy two-point correlation function is reproduced. This algorithm constitutes a major improvement over previous methods, which either neglected the presence of large-scale structure, neglected the presence of galaxies, neglected the contribution of distant matter (matter located far from the beam), or used the Zeldovich approximation for simulating the formation of large-scale structure. In addition, we take into account the observed morphology-density relation when assigning morphological types to galaxies, something that was ignored in all previous studies.\r\n\r\n    To test this algorithm, we perform 1981 simulations for three different cosmological models: an Einstein-de Sitter model with density parameter Î©0 = 1, an open model with Î©0 = 0.2, and a flat, low-density model with Î©0 = 0.2 and a cosmological constant of Î»0 = 0.8. In all models, the initial density fluctuations correspond to a cold dark matter power spectrum normalized to COBE. In each simulation, we compute the shear and magnification resulting from the presence of inhomogeneities. Our results are the following: (1) The magnification is totally dominated by the convergence, with the shear contributing less than one part in 104. (2) Most of the cumulative shear and magnification is contributed by matter located at intermediate redshifts, z = 1-2. (3) The actual value of the redshift at which the largest contribution to shear and magnification occurs depends on the cosmological model. In particular, the lens planes contributing the most are located at larger redshift for models with smaller Î©0. (4) The number of galaxies directly hit by the beam increases with redshift, while the contribution of lens planes to the shear and magnification decrease with increasing lens plane redshift for z > 2, which indicates that the bulk of the shear and magnification does not originate from direct hits, but rather from the tidal influence of nearby and more distant galaxies and background matter. (5) The average contributions of background matter and nearby galaxies to the shear is comparable for models with small Î©0. For the Einstein-de Sitter model, the contribution of the background matter exceeds the contribution of nearby galaxies by nearly 1 order of magnitude.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1086/305104','','http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/493/1/10','AS-ITB @ ati @','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',539,NULL,'no','2010-10-28','11:48:56','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-28','11:48:56','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Makmur, L.; Syamsurizal,; Tukiran,; Achmad, S.A.; Aimi, N.; Hakim, E.H.; Kitajima, M.; Takayama, H.',NULL,NULL,'Makmur, L',3,'Artoindonesianin C, a New Xanthone Derivative from Artocarpus teysmanii',NULL,'Journal of Natural Products',NULL,2000,'63',63,'2','243-244',243,NULL,'A new xanthone derivative, artoindonesianin C (1), was isolated from Artocarpus teysmanii, together with two known prenylated flavonoids, cycloartobiloxanthone and artonin J.

This is consistent with their formation by a regiospecific polymerization of C1 species derived from CO and initiated by 13C2H4. Although the activities toward individual products differed somewhat, similar distributions and similar product labeling patterns were obtained over all the four catalysts. 1-Butene and the higher 1-n-alkenes from all the catalysts were largely 13CH313CH2(CH2)nCHCH2 (n = 0âˆ’3), propene formed over Ru or Co was 13CH313CHCH2, while both 13CH313CHCH2 and 13CH213CHCH3 were formed over Fe or Rh. Comparison of the conclusions from these probe experiments with those from isotope transient experiments by other workers indicates that the ethene initiator does not significantly modify the course of the CO hydrogenation. The reaction products are largely kinetically determined, and the primary products are mainly linear 1-n-alkenes, while the n-alkanes and 2-n-alkenes largely arise via secondary processes. Since the distribution of products and the labeling in them is so similar, it is concluded that one basic primary mechanism applies over all the four metals. Several different reaction paths involving a polymerization of surface methylene, CH2(ad), have been proposed. Although the predictions based on several of these mechanisms agree with many of the results, the alkenyl + CH2(ad) mechanism, initiated by a surface vinyl CH2CH(ad), most easily accommodates the experimental evidence. An alternative path involving sequential addition of surface methylidyne and hydride either to a growing alkylidene chain (alkylidene + CH(ad) + H(ad)) or to an alkyl chain (alkyl + CH(ad) + H(ad)) has recently been proposed by van Santen and Ciobica. The CH2(ad) mechanism offers an easier explanation for the formation of the various alkenes, the distribution of products, and of the initiation, while the CH(ad) + H(ad) mechanism can explain any n-alkanes formed as primary products and not derived from alkenes. At higher reaction temperatures over Ru and Co, considerable 13C1 incorporation (from natural abundance in the CO and from cleavage of the 13C2H4 probe) was found in all the hydrocarbons. Thus, at higher temperatures 13C1(ad) in addition to 13C2(ad) species participate in both chain growth and initiation. In summary, adsorbed CO is transformed very easily into surface C1(ad), probably CH2(ad) in equilibrium with CH(ad)+H(ad), which act as the propagating species.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1021/ja026280v','','','FMIPA-ITB @ sulaeman @ turner_investigations_2002','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',443,NULL,'no','2010-10-23','15:49:25','Sulaeman Sulaeman (sulaeman@fmipa.itb.ac.id)','2011-01-27','02:22:37','Admin FMIPA Publications (admin@pubs.fmipa.itb.ac.id)',1),('Suendo, V.; Eto, R.; Osaki, T.; Higa, M.; Tanioka, A.','','','Suendo, V',3,'Ionic Environmental Effect on the Time-Dependent Characteristics of Membrane Potential in a Bipolar Membrane','','Journal of Colloid and Interface Science','',2001,'240',240,'1','162-171',162,'','The membrane potential characteristics of a bipolar membrane are discussed in an examination of the contribution of an intermediate phase to time-dependent behavior.

Distribution of Cr and endogenous elements within A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, following treatment with Cr(VI) (100 mgrM, 20 min or 4 h) were studied by synchrotron-radiation-induced X-ray emission (SRIXE) of single freeze-dried cells. After the 20-min treatment, Cr was confined to a small area of the cytoplasm and strongly co-localized with S, Cl, K, and Ca. After the 4-h treatment, Cr was distributed throughout the cell, with higher concentrations in the nucleus and the cytoplasmic membrane. This time-dependence corresponded to ~100% or 0% clonogenic survival of the cells following the 20-min or 4-h treatments, respectively, and could potentially be explained by a new cellular protective mechanism. Such processes may also be important in reducing the potential hazards of Cr(III) dietary supplements, for which there is emerging evidence that they exert their anti-diabetic effects via biological oxidation to Cr(VI). The predominance of Cr(III) was confirmed by micro-XANES spectroscopy of intracellular Cr hotspots. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS, using freeze-dried cells after the 0â€“4-h treatments) was used to gain insight into the chemical structures of Cr(III) complexes formed during the intracellular reduction of Cr(VI).

Pollen grains contain allergen proteins, enzymes, and bioactive lipid mediators, the latter two possibly involved in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases through IgE-independent mechanisms. Methods: We analyzed the patterns of release of endopeptidases from allergenic pollen of Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, and Rocky mountain juniper, which belong to the Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae family, and birch, ragweed, and two grasses, Kentucky blue and cultivated rye, using synthetic substrates, class-specific inhibitors, and zymography. The proteins released were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Eicosanoid-like substances were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4. Results: Major fractions of proteins, eicosanoid-like substances, and at least one molecular species of serine endopeptidase were released into phosphate-buffered saline from the pollen grains at 37Â°C within 25 min or 60 min without sonication. In the Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae family, sonication was necessary for the release of other proteins and another serine endopeptidase. In birch, ragweed, and the grasses, most of the serine and cysteine endopeptidases were released without sonication. Proteases released within 25 min digested gelatin and/or casein differently among plant species. Conclusions: Grains of allergenic pollen release proteases, which can digest not only short synthetic substrates but also protein substrates, along with eicosanoid-like substances and proteins. The release of these components could contribute to the formation of a microenvironment optimum for initiation of the sensitization or the exacerbation of pollen allergy in tissues exposed to pollen grains.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1423-0097',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=000144035','MA-ITB @ adedi @ gunawan_characterization_2008','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,493,NULL,'no','2010-10-25','09:01:14','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-25','09:01:14','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)',1),('Gunawan, H.',NULL,NULL,'Gunawan, H',1,'Maximal Functions and Harmonic Analysis',NULL,'Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society',NULL,1993,'47',47,'02','351',351,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=4855644','MA-ITB @ adedi @ gunawan_maximal_1993','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,494,NULL,'no','2010-10-25','09:01:14','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-25','09:01:14','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)',1),('Wang, X.-L.; Takai, T.; Kamijo, S.; Gunawan, H.; Ogawa, H.; Okumura, K.',NULL,NULL,'Wang, X-L',3,'NADPH oxidase activity in allergenic pollen grains of different plant species',NULL,'Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications',NULL,2009,'387',387,'3','430-434',430,'Birch, Grass, Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, NADPH oxidase, Pollen allergy, Ragweed, Reactive oxygen species','Pollen is an important trigger of allergic diseases.

We make two assumptions for our system. The first assumption is that the frequencies of the characteristic oscillations are widely separated and the second is that the nonlinear part of the vector field preserves the distance to the origin. Using the first assumption, we prove that the reduced normal form of our system has an invariant manifold which exists for all values of the parameters. This invariant manifold cannot be perturbed away by including higher order terms in the normal form. Using the second assumption, we view the normal form as an energy-preserving three-dimensional system which is linearly perturbed. Restricting ourselves to a small perturbation, the flow of the energy-preserving system is used to study the flow in general.

In this paper we formulate a mathematical model of the spread of anti-malarial drug resistance in the population. The model is suitable for malarial situations in developing countries. We consider the sensitive and resistant strains of malaria. There are two basic reproduction ratios corresponding to the strains. If the ratios corresponding to the infections of the sensitive and resistant strains are not equal and they are greater than one, then there exist two endemic non-coexistent equilibria. In the case where the two ratios are equal and they are greater than one, the coexistence of the sensitive and resistant strains exist in the population. It is shown here that the recovery rates of the infected host and the proportion of anti-malarial drug treatment play important roles in the spread of anti-malarial drug resistance.

When faced with particularly challenging equations, such as singular perturbation problems, the most efficient codes use a highly non-uniform grid in order to resolve the non-smooth parts of the solution trajectory. This grid is usually constructed using either a pointwise local error estimate defined at the grid points or else by using a local residual control. Similar error estimates are used to decide whether or not to accept a solution. Such an approach is very effective in general providing that the problem to be solved is well conditioned. However, if the problem is ill conditioned then such grid refinement algorithms may be inefficient because many iterations may be required to reach a suitable mesh on which to compute the solution. Even worse, for ill conditioned problems an inaccurate solution may be accepted even though the local error estimates may be perfectly satisfactory in that they are less than a prescribed tolerance. The primary reason for this is, of course, that for ill conditioned problems a small local error at each grid point may not produce a correspondingly small global error in the solution. In view of this it could be argued that, when solving a two-point boundary value problem in cases where we have no idea of its conditioning, we should provide an estimate of the condition number of the problem as well as the numerical solution.

Solitary waves carry a mass that depends on the amplitude (momentum) and the quasi-homogeneous approximation has to be modified to satisfy mass-conservation. This is achieved by introducing an additional parameter in the base functions with which the distortion is approximated. Instead of using pure solitary waves, one modification consists of adding a tail of finite, but varying length and amplitude. When the bottom decreases sufficiently fast far away from the wave, an alternative description of the distortion will be presented as a succession of solitary waves above a varying, non-flat equilibrium elevation of the surface. In both cases, the dynamic equations obtained from energy and mass conservation differ in essential order from the result without modification.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0165-2125',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6TW5-3VTNFKG-8/2/b373ffe38845056a2aef686b909a8922','MA-ITB @ adedi @ pudjaprasetya_unidirectional_1996','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,527,NULL,'no','2010-10-25','11:07:48','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)','2010-10-25','11:07:48','Dedi Supriadi (adedi@math.itb.ac.id)',1),('Groesen, E. van; Pudjaprasetya, S.R.',NULL,NULL,'Groesen, E van',2,'Uni-directional waves over slowly varying bottom.

If in the case of an even bottom one restricts further to uni-directional waves, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) is obtained. For slowly varying bottom this uni-directionalization will be studied in detail in this part I, in a very direct way which is simpler than other derivations found in the literature. The surface elevation is shown to be described by a forced KdV-type of equation. The modification of the obtained KdV-equation shares the property of the standard KdV-equation that it has a Hamiltonian structure, but now the structure map depends explicitly on the spatial variable through the bottom topography. The forcing is derived explicitly, and the order of the forcing, compared to the first order contributions of dispersion and nonlinearity in KdV, is shown to depend on the ratio between l and L; for very mild bottom variations, the forcing is negligible.

This similarity allows the study of H impurity emission in terms of D emission from the D-doped samples and thereby separating it from the H emission originating from the water molecules.

Using polystyrene (PS) particles with varied zeta potentials as templates, it is also possible to form highly ordered porous and hollow aggregates from inorganic colloidal particles.

The methods used are high temperature susceptibility series expansions and Monte Carlo simulations. We have extended the multigraph expansion method up to 13th order for the susceptibility. We also investigate the application of Schwinger-Dyson equations to these models. The critical properties of the models are obtained through: (1) analysis of the series by using the ratio method, the Pade approximant method and in some cases the more general differential approximant method, (2) Monte Carlo simulations; by observations of the specific heat peaks in the specific heat-temperature diagrams and by integrating the energy to obtain the entropy for cases where the energy-temperature diagrams show strong hysteresis. We have obtained the phase diagrams for special cases of the models: (1) the J_1 - J_2 model (J_3 = 0), (2) the BNNNI model (J_2 = 0) and (3) the Widom model of microemulsions (J_2/J_3 = 2). Phase diagrams for more general cases ( J_2/J_3 = 2.5, 1.0 and J _3/J_1 = -1.0 in two dimensions were also obtained. Our work confirms previous results for the breakdown of universality in the superantiferromagnetic region for the J_1 - J_2 model, and gives more accurate estimates for the critical parameters. For the BNNNI model, and for the I123 model in the region J_2/J_3 \\textless 2, we find complex behaviour showing a possible sequence of transitions in the modulated region. For the Widom model in two dimensions we find that the critical temperature in the region of strong antiferromagnetic J_3 is very small or perhaps zero.

The convergence of L2 approximations to continuum and bound states is investigated in the hydrogenic case. The connection between the L2 approximation and pseudo states is derived by studying the completeness relation for the exact states and the quadrature approximations. Corresponding equivalent weights are shown to be related to a Gaussian quadrature derived from attractive-Coulomb Pollaczek polynomials. Gaussian quadrature rules that are satisfied are calculated numerically. The use of pseudo states in the close-coupling equations is discussed especially in relation to the Poet [1978] model which gives a highly accurate solution for a simplified model of electron-hydrogen collisions in which only s-wave hydrogen target states are admitted. The convergence of channel potentials which contribute to the close-coupling equations is then examined and discussed the convergence of pseudostate Born amplitudes is studied as a further test in obtaining a good pseudo-state set. In addition, the convergence rate of the L2 approximation to the bound-bound, bound-free channel and free-free channel potentials is examined. The bound-bound, bound-free potentials are shown to converge geometrically while the free-free potentials have very slow convergence. In order to examine the effect of convergence rates several detailed models are employed and compared with the full Poet calculations.

Most remarkable is the narrow line width and low continuum background exhibited by emission lines of the analyte atoms from helium plasma, including the hydrogen emission line which is known to suffer from notorious broadening effects in conventional laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). It is further shown on the basis of the measured spatial distributions and time profiles of the emission intensities, that the excellent spectral quality is attained by taking advantage of the meta-stable excited state of helium atoms for the delayed excitation of the hydrogen and other analyte atoms, this allows the detection of those atomic emissions to be performed under more favorable conditions. The result of this study has thus demonstrated the feasibility of achieving high-quality spectrochemical analysis, including hydrogen analysis with laser-induced helium gas breakdown spectroscopy.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0946-2171',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1007/s00340-006-2566-6',NULL,NULL,'KI-ITB @ handi @ ramli_notes_2007','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,'10.1007/s00340-006-2566-6',708,NULL,'no','2010-11-08','15:11:52','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)','2010-11-08','15:11:52','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',1),('Surahmat; Baskoro, E.; Tomescu, I.',NULL,NULL,'Surahmat',3,'The Ramsey Numbers of Large cycles Versus Odd Wheels',NULL,'Graphs and Combinatorics',NULL,2008,'24',24,NULL,'53-58',53,NULL,'For given graphs G and H, the Ramsey number R(G, H) is the smallest positive integer N such that for every graph F of order N the following holds: either F contains G as a subgraph or the complement of F contains H as a subgraph.

Plots of Born-Haber lattice energies (U(BHC)) vs. U(G), U(GJ) and U(YF) resulted in R 2 = 0.8872, 0.5919, and 0.9982. Thus the obtained best fit was U(BHC) vs. U(YF). The simple equation describing the best plot wasU perovskite oxide = [ 1,0579U(YF) - 835,06 ] kJ/mol. Molecular simulation method has also been carried out to determine lattice energy and the obtained results were compared with those obtained from simple lattice energy equation, good agreement were obtained in these two oxides series.

One of the important substructures is given by phenylacetylene, Ph-CÂºCH. Its rotational behavior in its pure form and in high dilution in hexamethylphosphoric triamide OP[N(CH 3 ) 2 ] 3 (HMPA) has been studied by means 13 C NMR T 1 relaxation times at ambient temperature as measured by the inversion recovery method. HMPA is an exceptional solvent in that is has a quite large dipole moment but comparatively low relative dielectricity constant. From the molecular shape Ph-C Âº CH is expected to exhibit anisotropic rotational diffusion which in fact can be deduced from the measured set of T 1 values of the ortho, meta and para carbon nuclei in the neat liquid as well as in the HMPA solution. This expected result rules the dominance of a linearly molecules pair Ph-C Âº CH...HMPA along their dipole moment axes as anticipated in view of the large HMPA dipole moment. In order to conform with the T 1 data, a linear arrangement of Ph-C Âº CH via the interaction between its weakly acidic H-atom with negatively charge O-atom of HMPA molecules seems to lead to such an anisotropic rotational motion. This hypothesis is supported by ab initio QM calculations which come out with higher interaction energy for linear orientation than other geometries. These ab initio calculations were performed with the basis set of RHF/6-31G(d) for the single molecules of Ph-C Âº CH and HMPA as well as for their various geometries of the molecules pair. Molecular dynamics simulations need to be performed for further confirmation.

Mechanisms of resistance are an appropriate target for molecular genotyping diagnostic methods. Here we examined the multiplex PCR assays for the rapid detection targeting rpoB526, rpoB531 , and katG mutations. Sixty-one M. tuberculosis strains were studied based on rpoB526, rpoB531 , and katG315 assays employing multiplex PCR.

The mutation profiles of the 42 MDR strains assayed by multiplex PCR were 81 and 38.1% on rpoB and katG , respectively. Six rifampin-resistant isolates (60%) had a mutation on rpoB , 25% isoniazid-resistant isolates had mutation on katG , and 20% of the isolates that were sensitive to all drugs tested had a mutation on rpoB .

The potentials have been measured against the decamethylferrocenium/decamethylferrocene (Me10Fc+/0) couple, which is much less solvent-dependent than the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/0) couple, and hence gives a more accurate reflection of the solvent dependence of the C60n-/(n+1)- couples. The formal redox potentials of the C60n-/(n+1)- couples exhibit substantial dependences on the solvent and become more solvent-dependent as the charge increases. This dependence arises from two main interactions with the solvents: hydrogen-bonding interactions with acidic functionality and electrostatic interactions with solvent dipoles. The strength of the hydrogen-bonding interaction increases as the square of the solute charge due to the increase in basicity of the fullerides. In addition to the contribution of the hydrogen-bonding acidity and the solvent dipoles, the potentials of the C600/1- couple are influenced by the Lewis basicities of the solvents. The latter is likely to be due to ion-pair formation between the fullerides and the Bu4N+ ion and/or interactions between the Lewis basicity of the solvent and the Me10Fc+ ion of the reference couple. This interaction is much smaller compared to the solvent/solute interaction. pi-Stacking interactions between C60 and aromatic solvents results in a significant contribution of polarizability to the first reduction. The solvent dependences of the fullerenes can be used to model electrode/solvent interactions in which the surface (albeit a distorted one) goes from the point-of-zero-charge (C60) to a variety of discrete negative surface charges (fullerides).',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1021/jp9707403',NULL,NULL,'KI-ITB @ handi @ noviandri_solvent_1997','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,881,NULL,'no','2010-11-09','12:11:05','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)','2010-11-09','12:11:05','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',1),('Rosi, M.; Ekaputra, M.P.; Abdullah, M.; Khairurrijal',NULL,NULL,'Rosi, M',3,'Synthesis and Characterization of Cross-linked Polymer Electrolyte Membranes for Supercapacitor',NULL,'AIP Conference Proceedings',NULL,2010,'1284',1284,'1','55-58',55,'infrared spectra, Nanostructured materials, Polymer electrolytes, semiconductor doping',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1063/1.3515561',NULL,'http://link.aip.org/link/?APC/1284/55/1','FI-ITB @ dede @ rosi_synthesis_2010','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,1196,NULL,'no','2010-11-12','07:48:13','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)','2010-11-12','07:48:13','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)',1),('Syarif, D.G.; Soepriyanto, S.; Ismunandar; Korda, A.','','','Syarif, DG',3,'Synthesis of 8YSZ-LSGM Composite Thick Film Ceramics for Solid Electrolyte From Nanopowder Utilizing Local Zircon Prepared Using Sol Gel Process','','AIP Conference Proceedings','',2010,'1284',1284,'1','46-50',46,'Nanostructured materials, sol-gel processing, thick films, X-ray diffraction','',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1063/1.3515559','','http://link.aip.org/link/?APC/1284/46/1','FI-ITB @ dede @ syarif_synthesis_2010','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',1197,NULL,'no','2010-11-12','07:48:13','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)','2011-01-27','02:08:59','Admin FMIPA Publications (admin@pubs.fmipa.itb.ac.id)',1),('Amran, M.B.; J.F., L.M.',NULL,NULL,'Amran, MB',2,'SpÃ©ciation des composÃ©s de lâ€™arsenic.

The couples were studied in 29 solvents and the differences in formal redox potentials between the MenFc+/0 (n = 5, 10) and Fc+/0 couples are surprisingly solvent dependent. In the case of the Fc+/0 couple versus the Me10Fc+/0 couple, the potential difference ranges from +583 mV in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol to +293 mV in water. The positive shifts for the Me5Fc+/0 couple versus the Me10Fc+/0 couple were about half of these values. The Me10Fc+/0 redox couple can also be used in easily oxidized solvents, such as N-methylaniline and N,N-dimethylaniline, or in conjunction with a Hg working electrode.

The spectra of MWC 1080 were used to classify the spectral type as being early A with a luminosity class of Ib-II. The Balmer-series lines show prominent P Cygni profiles up to H-epsilon.

The new construction leads to an improvement in the K(n; d) problem. Additionally, for d = 2 we can combine our construction with â€™digon reductionâ€™ to construct other new digraphs with minimum diameter, thus improving the K(n; 2) problem even further.

Attention is given to the second nova, noting asymmetries resulting from uneven mass ejection. The binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 is examined in an effort to obtain empirical support for the scenario. It is suggested that the kick, i.e., ejection velocity, required to produce the observed parameters of the binary pulsar should be larger than 80 kms if the mass of the exploding star is larger than 4 solar masses.

In a massive binary scenario, the present age of the neutron star in the system must be of the order of the main-sequence lifetime of the about 2 solar mass nondegenerate component (about 500 Myr). This large age is incompatible with the evidence of a high magnetic field strength observed in the X-ray source since within this time span the magnetic field should have decayed substantially. A low-mass binary scenario is adopted in which the neutron star was formed by accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf. The neutron star can be considerably younger (about 10 Myr) which is more compatible with the observed strong magnetic field. In order to reach its present distance outside the galactic plane within its lifetime, the system must have acquired a runaway velocity over 70 km/sec.

The identification of the origin of wood is particularly important in order to identify illegally harvested and traded timber and wood products. We describe success rates of DNA isolation from wood based on a simple, previously published extraction protocol. The protocol was used to isolate DNA from a total of 406 wood samples, mainly of the important tropical tree family Dipterocarpaceae. The reliability of the extraction method was confirmed by comparing fragment sizes and sequences after isolation of DNA from leaves and wood of the same trees. We observed the success of amplification of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments of different lengths by means of PCR, investigated key factors influencing PCR, and conducted inhibitor tests for a subset of the samples. The average rate of successful PCR amplification was 75.7%. Main factors influencing the success of PCR amplification were the size of the amplified fragment and the processing status of the wood. Short fragments and unprocessed wood resulted in higher success rates. The success rate was also dependent on the age (storage duration) of the wood probe and on the investigated species. Amplification success was higher if DNA was isolated from outer sapwood (without cambium) in comparison to DNA isolated from the transition zone between sapwood and heartwood and the inner heartwood. However, inhibitor tests also indicated more PCR inhibitory substances in the outer sapwood in comparison to transition wood and heartwood. The addition of polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP) to the lysis buffer proved to be highly efficient to improve the amplification success if inhibitory substances were present.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1872-4973',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1016/j.fsigen.2009.01.002',NULL,'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B8CX7-4VHXF3R-2/2/872c821b3fdf6b96088a2205c3bf0108','KI-ITB @ handi @ rachmayanti_dna_2009','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,1035,NULL,'no','2010-11-09','16:29:38','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)','2010-11-09','16:29:38','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',1),('Williamson, R.A.; Natalia, D.; Gee, C.K.; Murphy, G.; Carr, M.D.; Freedman, R.B.',NULL,NULL,'Williamson, RA',3,'Chemically and Conformationally Authentic Active Domain of Human Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 Refolded from Bacterial Inclusion Bodies',NULL,'European Journal of Biochemistry',NULL,1996,'241',241,'2','476-483',476,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0014-2956',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00476.x',NULL,'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00476.x/full','KI-ITB @ handi @ williamson_chemically_1996','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,1036,NULL,'no','2010-11-09','16:29:38','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)','2010-11-09','16:29:38','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',1),('Natalia, D.; Yuliani, Y.; Ermayadhie, Y.; Putra, R.; Sindumarta, M.',NULL,NULL,'Natalia, D',3,'Thermostable glucoamylase-type enzyme fromBacillus acidocaldarius RP1',NULL,'Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education',NULL,2002,'30',30,'6','398-400',398,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1470-8175',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,'10.1002/bmb.2002.494030060137',NULL,'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bmb.2002.494030060137/full','KI-ITB @ handi @ natalia_thermostable_2002','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,1038,NULL,'no','2010-11-09','16:29:38','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)','2010-11-09','16:29:38','Handi Handani (handi@mail.chem.itb.ac.id)',1),('Natalia, D.; MUHARSINI, S.R.I.; MASDUKI, F.I.F.I.F.I.T.R.I.A.H.; WARDHANA, A.P.R.I.L.H.A.R.I.; WARDANI, S.A.V.I.R.A.E.K.A.; MARIA, E.L.I.Z.A.B.E.T.H.; HEUVEL, J.O.O.P.V.A.N.D.E.N.',NULL,NULL,'Natalia, D',3,'Production of Recombinant Vaccine Cb Peritrophin-42 of Screwworm Fly in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae',NULL,NULL,NULL,2010,'1',1,'3',NULL,NULL,'Chrysomya bezziana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, vaccine','The screwworm fly ( Chrysomya bezziana ) larva is an obligate parasite which causes myasis in mammals.

The results indicate that the annual variations of the regressions of the Martian Polar Caps is seen to have a periodical nature. The main period is found to be approximately 40 years while other periodical components of shorter duration seen in the data also exist. The shorter periods are 3, 6 and 8 years respectively. The 3 years period may be attributed to the systematic effect of 2-3 years interval in which the data was acquired. The 6 years may be a subharmonic component of the 3 years period, though it is blended. The 8 years period cannot be attributed to the same effects of observations, such as the cyclic appearances of each polar caps in the Martian epoch of observations. Irregularity of the epoch interval of observations prevent such a systematic effect to be seen. Therefore, we like to point out that the 8-years period is a real physical phenomenon of the annual variations of the polar regressions. This strongly support the findings of Iwasaki and Ebisawa on sizes of the South Polar Cap. The PDM-method is sufficiently general to analyze small sets of data involving missing observations and non-sinusoidal time variations.

The Solar Cycle is observed to vary from 14 to 8 years in length. The reconstructions of the annual solar total irradiance since the beginning of Maunder Minimum (from year 1600) to year 2000 show that there are envelopes of groups sunspot numbers. The intensities delineated by the envelopes are consistent with the range of CaII brightness. The timelength of the envelopes corresponds to long term variabilities such as the Gleissberg Cycle of 88 and 124 years period. A close correlation between total irradiance and sunspot number from 1610 to 2000 is found to be 0.88. Although the work of Labitzke and van Loon has clearly shown the existence of an oscillation in many atmospheric parameters with a period in the vicinity of 11 years and a phase that is related to that of solar activity, there is reluctance to accept a relationship to the 11-year solar cycle. Therefore this study aimed to pursue the investigations further by determining the correlation coefficients to lower trophospheric layers. Our studies reveal to results, which we summarized as follows: A weak correlation at 27 month delay is found between solar activities and the El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a phenomena. The next El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a event is expected to occur from year 2002 until mid 2003. A major change in the pattern of the solar cycle since 1700 appears. The sun is seen to be more frequent in its active states over the last 100 years. The length of the cycle is becoming shorter. The solar cycles modulate from 5, 8, 12 and 25-year period obtained from its total irradiance plot. The 5-year period coincides very well within the El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a period of 2 to 7-year. The El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a phenomenon has a 10-12 month duration. Every El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a event is separated from 24 to 84 months duration in an irregular pattern. Every El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a event is unique. These conclusions are drawn after decomposing the SST Anomaly Index through applied Fourier Transform. The effect of the solar cycle variations is to generate long period harmonics in the coming El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a events. We expect that more variability in climate will occur in the coming decade.',NULL,'','','','','','','','',NULL,'','','','','','','Miscellaneous',NULL,NULL,'','','http://jms.fmipa.itb.ac.id/index.php/jms/article/view/56','AS-ITB @ ati @ ref_solar_2009','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)','','no','','','',1073,NULL,'no','2010-11-10','08:54:35','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)','2010-11-10','09:36:30','Abdhiany Murtiawaty (ati@as.itb.ac.id)',1),('Aprilia Aprilia, Djoni N.

This trend was found to have its origin in the decreasing laser power density arriving at the crater bottom and thereby weakened the shock wave generated in the crater. As the crater deepened, the declining trend of the intensity appeared to level off as a result of compensation of the decreasing laser power density by the enhanced plasma confinement at increasing crater depth. Meanwhile, the result also reveals the significant contribution of the He-assisted excitation process to the doped hydrogen and deuterium emission intensities, leading to similar crater-depth dependent variation patterns in contrast to that associated with the surface water, with growing dominance of this common feature at the later stage of the plasma expansion.

In this study, an amino acid (e.g. lysine) was utilized to catalyze and to maintain the silica formation due to its ability in covering prepared silica after reaction. Further, another advantage of this catalyst is more harmless than other catalysts (e.g. ammonia, N2H4). The result showed spherical particles with controllable pore size (from 4 to 15 nm) and outer diameter (from 20 to 80 nm) was produced. The ability to control pore size and outer diameter was drastically altered by adjusting the concentration of styrene and hydrophobic molecules, respectively. After the preparation of particle was understood clearly, the large-molecule-adsorption performance of the prepared porous particles was conducted. As expected, relatively large organic molecules (i.e. Rhodamine B) were well-absorbed in the prepared sample but not by the commercial non-porous particles.

The current detection was performed by placing a partially transmitting metal mesh electrode at a distance of 7 mm from the sample surface with the sample serving as the counter electrode. The electric field between the mesh and sample surface was set up and varied by applying a dc high voltage (0â€“400 V) between them. The laser plasma was generated by a Nd:YAG laser (64 mJ, 8 ns) tightly focused on a Cu sample through the mesh electrode in surrounding gas of various low pressures. Three Cu emission lines associated with different excited energy levels were detected, namely the Cu(I) 510.5 nm (3.8 eV), Cu(I) 521.8 nm (6.2 eV), and Cu(I) 427.5 nm (7.8 eV) spectral lines. The correlation between the time profile of plasma emission and that of the charge current was examined to elucidate the roles of electron recombination and electron collision processes in the excitation of Cu atoms in the plasma.

The result of this study has thus failed to turn up evidence for the significant roles of electron recombination and electron collision comparable to the role of the shock wave mechanism in the plasma emission process.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Journal Article',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://as.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=as-56-8-994','FI-ITB @ dede @ pardede_direct_2002','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,NULL,1136,NULL,'no','2010-11-11','10:25:25','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)','2010-11-11','10:25:25','Dede Enan (dede@fi.itb.ac.id)',1),('Ogi, T.; Iskandar, F.; Yabuki, A.; Okuyama, K.',NULL,NULL,'Ogi, T',3,'Control of particle morphology from porous to hollow by spray-drying with a two-fluid nozzle and template materials',NULL,'Kagaku Kogaku Ronbunshu',NULL,2007,'33',33,'5','468-475',468,'Hollow particle, Nanocolloids, Polystyrene latex, Porous particle, Spray drying','Spray-drying with a two-fluid nozzle was used to produce composite particles consisting of silica or titania nanocolloids and template particles (polystyrene latex; PSL).

Their phosphate bands were compared to those of synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAP) and human enamel, while their carbonate bands were compared to those of coral (oculina sp) and sea urchin (psammechinus miliaris) skeletons. It is well known that mineral compounds in human enamel consist mainly of calcium phosphates with a small amount of carbonates, while those found in coral and sea urchin skeletons consist mainly of calcium carbonates, coexisting with significant amount of magnesium. In contrast to those compositions, the spectroscopic data presented in this work display a strong indication that comparable amounts of calcium carbonates and calcium phosphates do exist in giant prawn skeletons during most of their moulting period. Based on the infrared analysis of the carbonate bands it is further suggested that calcium carbonates experience partial conversion from the amorphous to the crystal phase toward the end of the moulting cycle, as confirmed by similar trend exhibited in XRD data.

At room temperature orbital fluctuations are dominant. Below 188 K a structural phase transition from orthorhombic Pbnm to monoclinic Pb11 symmetry takes place, corresponding to a state where strong orbital fluctuations are superimposed on an underlying orbitally ordered state. However, the fluctuations are not strong enough to give rise to a long-range orbitally dimerized state as theoretically predicted. Ordering of the vanadium spins at 114 K has little effect on the orbital fluctuations, but the orbital ordering becomes coherent below a first-order transition to an orthorhombic Pbnm phase at 40 K.

Meanwhile, the increasing disorder manifested by decreasing Tc also leads to the extended range of appearance for the second magnetization peak (SMP) and enlarged critical glassy region.

Initially, the orthorhombic Pbnm symmetry is lowered below a second-order phase transition at 200 K and recovers below 74 K at a first-order phase transition. Two Mott-Hubbard (MH) bands dominate the electronic spectrum in the visible range, followed by charge-transfer gap in UV.

The phase transition at Tt in LaVO3 or T0 in CeVO3 is due to a G-type orbital ordering which lowers the structure symmetry from orthorhombic Pbnm to monoclinic P2t/b11.

The difficulties associated with these experiments included the changes in physical properties of the gas mixture when temperature and pressure were varied. Changes in the relative humidity (RH) as a function of pressure and temperature also had a significant effect on the different behaviors of the mobility distributions of particles. In order to accomplish reliable measurement and minimize uncertainties, an integrated on-line control system was utilized. As the pressure decreased in a range of 500-980 hPa, the peak concentration of both ions and nanometer-sized particles decreased, which suggests that higher pressure tended to enhance the growth of particles nucleated by ion-induced nucleation. Moreover, the modal diameters of the measured particle size distributions showed a systematic shift to larger sizes with increasing pressure. However, in the temperature range of 5-20 Â°C, temperature increases had no significant effects on the mobility distribution of particles. The effects of residence time, RH (7%-70%), and SO2 concentration (0.08-6.7 ppm) on ion-induced nucleation were also systematically investigated. The results show that the nucleation and growth were significantly dependent on the residence time, RH, and SO2 concentration, which is in agreement with both a previous model and previous observations.

Because of this, there is abundant potential for their use in future technologies including electronic and optoelectronic, mechanical, chemical, cosmetic, medical, drug, and food technologies. However, due to their extremely small sizes, the particles suffer from many problems related to their surface and thermal stability, shape preservation, handling, assembly in devices, etc. It is therefore an important challenge to solve these problems by developing slightly larger particles (e.g. on the submicrometer scale) in which the properties generated by the nanoscale material are preserved. One approach to this is to trap nanoparticles in a micrometer-sized inert matrix. This approach allows the nanoscale properties to be retained, since nanoparticles are separated from each other in the inert matrix. The inert matrix also serves as a coating medium that inhibits any chemical changes to the surface of the nanoparticles. Their larger size allows easy handling or assembly in devices. A promising method for designing and fabricating these composite structures is a spray method, in which spherical particles can be produced. In this paper, we review the nanostructural processing (synthesis) of submicrometer-sized particles by a spray method, which provides a restricted reaction environment (such as pores or cages) in the matrix for their synthesis and handling.

The addition of urea into the precursor is the key factor for the formation of tetragonal BaTiO3 nanoparticles; the lack of urea addition led to the formation of submicrometer BaTiO3. The formation of BaTiO3 nanoparticles was suggested from the disintegration of submicrometer particles due to the decomposition of urea presented in the interconnection of their primary particles. Also, combustion of the decomposed gases of urea produced additional heat, which improved the tetragonality of the BaTiO3 nanoparticles. Tetragonality was enhanced from 1.0051 to 1.0071 by increasing the urea addition to as high as 4 M.

The degree of sintering of aggregated nanoparticles depended on the furnace temperature profile, residence time and primary particle size of the aggregated nanoparticles. Spherical monodispersed colloidal silica, in sizes ranging from 22 to 100 nm was selected as the primary particles. The sintering rate increased with temperature and residence time, and decreased with increasing primary particle size.

We analyze the residue type, and the bond length and bond strength between solvent water molecules in each temperature.

Activation of MAPK signaling also blocked exit from a G2 phase checkpoint arrest. Both the G2 phase delay and blocked exit from the G2 checkpoint arrest were mediated by the MEK1-dependent destabilization of the critical G2/M regulator cdc25B. Reintroduction of cdc25B overcame the MEK1-dependent G2 phase delay. Thus, we have demonstrated a new function for MEK1 that controls G2/M progression by regulating the stability of cdc25B.

There are three 14-3-3 binding sites on cdc25B, with Ser323 being the highest affinity binding and is highly homologous to the Ser214 14-3-3 binding site on cdc25C. Loss of 14-3-3 binding to Ser323 increases cyclin/cdk substrate access to the catalytic site thereby increasing its activity. It also affects the localization of cdc25B. Thus phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to this site is essential for down regulating cdc25B activity, blocking its mitosis promoting function. The question of how this inhibitory signal is relieved to allow cdc25B activation and entry into mitosis is yet to be resolved. Here we show that Ser323 phosphorylation is maintained into mitosis, but phosphorylation of Ser321 disrupts 14-3-3 binding to Ser323, mimicking the effect of inhibiting Ser323 phosphorylation on both cdc25B activity and localisation. The unphosphorylated Ser321 appears to have a role in stabilizing 14-3-3 binding to Ser323, and loss of the Ser hydroxyl group appears to be sufficient to significantly reduce 14-3-3 binding. A consequence of loss of 14-3-3 binding is dephosphorylation of Ser323. Ser321 is phosphorylated in mitosis by cdk1.
