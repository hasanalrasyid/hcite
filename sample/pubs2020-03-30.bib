	abstract = {Options are financial instruments that can be utilized to reduce risk in stock investment. Barrier options are one of the major types of options actively used in financial markets where its life period depends on the path of the underlying stock prices. The features of the barrier option can be used to modify other types of options. In this research, the barrier option will be implemented into power option, so it is called power barrier option. This option is an extension of the vanilla barrier options where the Call payoff being considered is defined as {PC}=max({STβ}−Kβ,0), and the Put payoff being considered is defined as {PP}=max(Kβ−{STβ},0). Here β {\textgreater} 0 and β ≠ 1, K is the strike price of the option, and {ST} is the price of the underlying stock at time maturity T. In this paper, we generate the prices of stock using binomial method which is adjusted to the power option. In the conclusion, the price of American power barrier option is more expensive than the price of European power barrier option.},

Subsequent calcination to produce {ZrO}2:Eu3+ nanofibers with diameters around 300 nm. The crystal structure and photoluminescence of the {ZrO}2:Eu3+ nanofibers were studied as a function of dopant concentration and heating temperature. At a dopant concentration of 5 mol \%, tetragonal phase crystals were observed. Photoluminescence spectra revealed several emission bands in the red region corresponding to the transition of 5D0→7FJ (J=1,2,3,4). Two most intense emission bands were observed at wavelengths of 606 and 591 nm due to the forced electric dipole (5D0→7F2) and magnetic dipole (5D0→7F1) transitions, respectively. This work demonstrates that one-dimensional photoluminescent materials can be generated by a two step electrospinning and calcination process.},

	abstract = {An efficient numerical scheme developed on the basis of Green’s function method is applied to the investigation of structural effects on the performance of planar grated waveguide at the first resonance wavelengths next to the band-edges. Restricting ourselves to the transverse-electric waves, this study is focused on the effects induced by variations of the grating cell number and the depths of its four outer grooves on both sides. The different patterns of groove depth gradation or apodization considered in this study are all characterized by decreasing depth toward the ends while retaining the longitudinal grating symmetry. The effects of the modifications are expressed in terms of changes in the modal transmittance, reflectance, and out-of-plane scattering loss as well as the group velocity and resonant field enhancement. The most favorable result characterized by 15\% transmittance enhancement and 85\% loss reduction is achieved for the case with the most gradual changes in the groove depth. It is further shown that, for the investigated range of parameters, both the group velocity and field enhancement can best be improved by increasing the length of the uniform grating, without introducing any modification.},

	abstract = {A solution showing the existence of both bright and dark spatial solitons by a simple modification of a previous approach is obtained for a model of reflection grating with modulated Kerr media without imposing specific restrictions on the physical parameters. The resulted relations of the system parameters and the pertinent physical quantities reveal an interesting algebraic structure and symmetry properties containing the previous results as special cases, with higher degrees of symmetry corresponding to more specific restrictions of the parameters. Detailed analysis of the associated parameter space exhibits clearly delineated regions for the different species of spatial solitons with wide ranging variations of characteristics as functions of the parameters. A practical working scheme is then formulated for tailoring the soliton characteristics according to a relatively simple rule. This is exemplified by a specific choice of soliton characteristics supported by a realistic set of system parameters in connection with the study of the dynamical process of soliton propagation in the system. A further study conducted on the dynamics of linear superpositions of two exact bright soliton pairs shows similar relative-phase dependent, attractive, and repulsive interactions as observed in a homogeneous medium while exhibiting visible envelope broadening due to the diffraction effect. The diffraction effect is shown to result in a wobbling phenomenon for the case of two bright solitons with asymmetric amplitudes. In the case of wide-stripe dark solitons, the propagation features a rapid split-off into several narrow stripes, and the number of new stripes depends proportionally on the width of the initial stripes as well as the ratio between its forward and backward amplitudes. Finally, an enhanced breathing phenomenon was demonstrated as a result of increased nonlinear modulation of the system.},

The field of passive nanostructures has reached the stage of dissemination into the private industries, while the second are still in the laboratory scale. The activities in the active nanostructures should be intensified in areas such as biosensors, which is a great importance to support the activities in the field of Agriculture, the field of Health‐ improvement as well as in environment protection.

	abstract = {Highly transparent undoped {ZnO} thin films have been prepared on glass and indium tin oxide substrates with simple process by sol‐gel route and dip‐coating deposition. Gel precursor of {ZnO} was prepared from zinc acetat dehydrate solution in methanol with the addition of trietylamine as stabilizing agent. Thin layer of gel precursor was prepared by dip coating and then followed by calcination at 400° C for 5 minute in air atmosphere. The thickness of the resulted {ZnO} thin film produced by ten times coating is about 150 nm. The films shows high transmittance larger than 98\% in the visible region (400–800 nm). Absorption is observed in the {UV} region with absorption onset at about 390 nm indicating varying band gap between 3.18 {eV} until 3.23 {eV} depending on the number of coating layer. The {AFM} image shows that the films seems to be constructed from random stacking of nano‐sized {ZnO} particle in the order of 50 nm. Among the prepared samples, the lowest resistivity is about 1.8×107 Ωm observed in the five‐layer coating film. In order to fabricate solar cell structure, P3HT was deposited onto the {ZnO} thin film layer by spin casting technique and then followed by metal (Au) layer deposition by thermal evaporation. The formed solar cell has the inverted type solar cell with {ITO}/{ZnO}/P3HT/Au configuration. By the insertion {ZnO} layer, the photocurrent was improved by more than ten orders of magnitude in comparison to that of without {ZnO} layer. The measured photocurrent decreases at large number of coating layer which is supposed to be related with the current limitation by the effective carrier path length in {ZnO} layer.},

Properly devised and applied, these have ability to reduce the influence of unusual data (outliers). The estimators always yield impedance estimates which are better than the conventional least square ({LS}) estimation because the ‘real’ {MT} data almost never satisfy the statistical assumptions of Gaussian distribution and stationary upon which normal spectral analysis is based. This paper discuses the development and application of robust estimation procedures which can be classified as M‐estimators to {MT} data. Starting with the description of the estimators, special attention is addressed to the recent development of a bounded‐influence robust estimation, including utilization of the Hilbert Transform ({HT}) operation on causal {MT} impedance functions. The resulting robust performances are illustrated using synthetic as well as real {MT} data.},

Single phase samples have been prepared by solid state reaction process using precursors of Bi2O3, {PbO}, {CaCO}3, {RE}2O3, and Co3O4. The precursors were pulverized, calcinated, and sintered in air at various temperatures for several hours. Analysis of {XRD} data shows that Bi1.5Pb0.5Ca1.9RE0.1Co2O8 compound is a layered system consisting of an alternate stack of {CoO}2 layer and Bi2Sr2O4 block along the c-axis. The misfit structure along b-direction is revealed from the difference of the b-axis length belonging to two sublattices, namely hexagonal {CdI}2-type {CoO}2 layer and rock-salt ({RS}) {NaCl}-type Bi2Sr2O4 block, while they possess the common a- and c-axis lattice parameters and β angles. The overall crystal structure parameters (a, b, and c) increases with type of doping from La to Ho, namely by decreasing the ionic radii of rare-earth ion. We discuss this phenomenon in terms of the lanthanide contraction, an effect commonly found in the rare-earth compound, results from poor shielding of nuclear charge by 4f electrons. In addition, the values of b-lattice parameters in these rare-earth doped samples are almost the same with those belongs to undoped parent compound (Bi1.5Pb0.5Sr2Co2O8) and its related Y-doped (Bi1.5Pb0.5Ca1.9Y0.1Co2O8) samples, while the c-values reduced significantly in rare-earth doped samples, with opposite trend with those of variation of a-axis length. Morevover, the misfit degree in rare-earth doped compound is higher in compared to parent compound and Y-doped samples. We argue that these structural changes induced by rare-earth doping may provide information for the variation of electronic structure of Co-ions (Co3+ and Co4+), in particular their different spin states of low-spin, intermediate-spin, and high-spin. This, in turn, will affect the thermoelectric properties (Seebeck coefficient) of the system.},

It was confirmed that the composite is crystalline with (002) and (004) orientations. In addition, it was also found that the composite has a high surface area, a high distribution of pore sizes less than 40 nm, and a high porosity (67\%). Noting that the pore sizes less than 20 nm are significant for ionic species storage and those in the range of 20 to 40 nm are very accessible for ionic clusters mobility across the pores, the composite is a promising material for the application as supercapacitor electrodes.},

The value of contrast is defined the different between brightness of the crescent and the sky divided by brightness of the sky. Some lunar crescent with {FI} (Fraction of illuminated area of the Moon) within 0.9\% to 1.1\% is assumed as hilal.

On the other hand, those energetic events could generate shock wave of solar energetic particles ({SEP}) and propagate in the inter‐planetary medium to disturb the Earth environment. Geomagnetic storm is a severe geomagnetic disturbance due solar source phenomena. The manifestations of storms are strong deviations in the Earth’s magnetic field from the quiet conditions that extend over wide geographic areas: from high‐latitude to mid‐latitude and equatorial regions. Large geomagnetic storms can cause deleterious effects on space‐ and ground‐based installations. We study magnetic cloud in connection to shock wave of {SEP} and geomagnetic storms on the November 20, 2003 and December 14, 2006 events. Magnetic clouds have already modeled. We identified magnetic cloud from the variation of magnetic field obtain from {MAG} instrument onboard {ACE} satellite with one hour resolution data. The steep fluctuations as a shock wave were computed and divided into magnetic field, proton speed and proton density. We study for each of their arrival time. We confirm that southward Bz component is dominant during magnetic cloud event. We also observed fine structures of a shock wave.

It means that the brightness of the moon is smaller than brightness of the sky. Based on the contrast value, it is impossible to observe the lunar crescent by the naked eye at that time, even equipped by special design telescope for the crescent observation at Bosscha Observatory. Sultan [11] proposed a predicted model it is still possible to observe the very young lunar crescent even under circumstance before the time of sunset, if the contrast of sky is perfect. On August 11, 2010 contrast has its maximum at 50 minutes after sunset. The result of observation of the lunar crescent at Bosscha Observatory, the crescent could be seen before sunset at 17.15 local time ({UT}+7 hours) using special design telescope with additional nose of 1 meter length [6].

It consist also around magnetite (34.35\%–59.85\%), Pyrite (18.3\%–29.71\%, Quartz (15.31\%–25.43\%), Garnet (1.73\%–3\%), Rutile (0.46\%), Chalcopyrite (0.17\%–1.46\%), Pyroxene (0.8\%–2.35\%), Hematite (3.49\%) and Iron oxide (1.80\%–4.81\%). Geoelectric data show a conductive layer with resistivity type between 1.38 ohm m‐47.3 ohm m. If this layer is correlated with well data, the deposition of sediment contains of Fe between 5.3\%–8.2\% and Copper between 0.18\%–0.23\%. This method is based on rock physics which done by correlating many laboratory experiment, field measurements and well data. Prediction of Fe and Cu found on every line is good enough, this is indicated by the {RMS} error of less than 5\%, against the actual data in each of the wells. Therefore, it shown that we can image the distribution of Fe and Cu accurately using the method.},

	abstract = {Self‐Potential ({SP}) is naturally occurring electric potential difference observed at the surface. In the vicinity of a cave, {SP} anomaly is dominantly generated by the resistivity contrast of the cave with its environment and the current source associated with the streaming potential generated by fluid flow through the cave. In this study we applied a simple qualitative analysis to understand the {SP} values caused by streaming potential and values that are due to the presence of caves. Further, we conducted two‐dimensional {SP} continuous modeling by solving the fluid velocity vector first in the modeling domain. Current source distribution and hence the {SP} value are obtained by incorporating resistivity value of the subsurface and calculating the divergence of the velocity vector. For validation, this scheme was applied in detection caves dug by Japanese army during {WWII} as at Djuanda Forest Park, Bandung. The results can be used to understand the characteristics of fluid flow and current source distribution around cavities that are responsible for the observed {SP} anomaly at the surface.},

The Augmented Dickey‐Fuller Test was employed on quarterly data for the period January 2000 to December 2008 to test for stationarity on the variables of interest. Estimates of the long‐term influence of exchange rate volatility on the trade flows are obtained using the Johansen Cointegration Test. The results suggest that a significant long‐term relationship linking exchange rate volatility and the trade volume between Indonesia and the United States exists. A negative long‐term relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and the export volume sent from Indonesia to the {US} is obtained. On the other hand, exchange rate volatility exerts a positive long‐term effect upon the import volume.},

The present study has the objective to estimate the effect of whole core configuration as well as burnup effects to the reactor core profile by adopting two dimensional model of fuel core management. About more than 40 months of cycle period has been employed for one cycle fuel irradiation of three batches fuel system for large water cooled thorium reactors. All position of fuel arrangement contributes to the total core conversion ratio which gives conversion ratio less than unity of at the {BOC} and it contributes to higher than unity (1.01) at the {EOC} after some irradiation process. Inner part and central part give the important part of breeding contribution with increasing burnup process, while criticality is reduced with increasing the irradiation time. Feasibility of breeding capability of water‐cooled thorium reactors for whole core fuel arrangement has confirmed from the obtained conversion ratio which shows higher than unity. Whole core analysis on evaluating reactivity change which is caused by the change of voided condition has been employed for conservative assumption that 100\% coolant and moderator are voided. It obtained always a negative void reactivity coefficient during reactor operation which shows relatively more negative void coefficient at {BOC} (fresh fuel composition), and it becomes less negative void coefficient with increasing the operation time. Negative value of void reactivity coefficient shows the reactor has good safety properties in relation to the reactivity profile which is the main parameter in term of criticality safety analysis. Therefore, this evaluation has confirmed that breeding condition and negative coefficient can be obtained simultaneously for water‐cooled thorium reactor obtains based on the whole core fuel arrangement.},

The patient blood and the dialyzing solution (dialysate) are flowed counter currently in a dialyzer to allow volume flux of fluid and diffusion of solutes from the blood to the dialysate through a semipermiable membrane. The volume flux of fluid depends on the hydrostatic and the osmotic pressure difference between the blood and the dialysate. It also depends on the membrane parameter that represents how the membrane allows the fluid and the solutes to move across as a result of the pressure difference, known as the ultrafiltration coefficient Kuf. The coefficient depends on the number and the radius of membrane pores for the movement of the fluids and the solutes across the membrane. The measured membrane ultrafiltration coefficient of reused dialyzer shows fluctuation between one uses to another without any significant trend of change. This indicates that the cleaning process carried out before reuse does not cause perfect removal of clots that happen in the previous use. Therefore the unblocked pores are forced to work hardly to obtain targeted volume flux in a certain time of treatment. This may increase the unblocked pore radius. Reuse is stopped when there is indication of blood leakage during the hemodialysis treatment.},

	abstract = {In geophysical testing, resistivity method is already widely employed. However, in developing countries the available resistivity equipment is mostly 1D resistivity system which employs four electrode configurations to measure the resistivity of soils. The multi channel resistivity system is simply too expensive for ordinary private geophysical company. Only governmental offices whose main job is to do geophysical research can afford to purchase multi channel resistivity system. In order to suppress the cost of the Multi Channel Resistivity System, this research develops multi channel resistivity system with programmable multiplexer switch and makes use of the already available 1D resistivity equipment as current injector. The new system consists of National Instruments {PXI} with programmable multiplexer switch cards, an Analog to Digital card to read the data, multi wires take‐out cables and thirty two electrodes.},

If one places a magnetic source on the vibrating object, so a magnetic sensor can measure its position by measuring the magnetic field strength from a reference position. There are two parameters that should be determined of a vibrating object, namely amplitude and frequency. Using Fourier Transform and a good mathematical model, these two parameters can be well determined. For this purpose, we have developed a vibration sensor based on fluxgate magnetic sensor. A mathematical model using 4th order polynomial approach has been developed for this sensor. Using this model, the developed sensor can measure vibration in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 g with relative errors below 3\%.},

One of them is oxygen. Oxygen is always found in the human blood. Its concentration in human blood gives information about the metabolism in the body. The purpose of this study was to look for a possibility for developing tool to detect the concentration of oxygen in blood. In this study, the giant‐magneto‐resistance ({GMR}) sensor is implemented. The {GMR} sensor has many attractive features, for example: reduced size, low‐power consumption, low price, as compared to other magnetic sensors and its electric and magnetic properties can be varied in very wide range. In this experiment, we developed the structure of {GMR} materials {NiCoFe}/Cu/{NiCoFe} sandwich as a {GMR} sensor. The {NiCoFe}/Cu/{NiCoFe} sandwiches were grown onto Si (111) substrates by the dc‐opposed target magnetron sputtering (dc‐{OTMS}) technique. The sputtering targets were {NiCoFe} and Cu. To achieve the aims of this study, the blood transports in human will be simulated using a simple experimental model. This model has some parameters representing those in blood transport. Furthermore, the nanomagnetic material will be made as a contaminant particle in blood. Using this material some properties of the transport will be investigated.},

For this reactor design, a suitable fuel‐loading scheme is the Peu à Peu (little by little) fueling scheme. In the Peu à Peu modus, there is no unloading device; as such, the fuels are never discharged and remain at the bottom of the core during reactor operation. This means that the burnup cycle and reactivity is controlled by the addition of fuel. The objectives of the the present study were to find a means of carrying out the exact calculations needed to analyze the Peu à Peu fuel‐loading scheme and to optimize the fuel composition, and fuel‐loading scheme to achieve better burnup characteristics. The Monte Carlo method is used to perform calculations with high accuracy. Before the calculation of the whole core, the analysis for the infinite geometry was performed. The power generated per mass consumed for each combination of the uranium enrichment and packing fraction was analyzed from the parametric survey. By using the optimal value obtained, a whole‐core calculation for the small 20 {MWth} reactor was performed and the criticality and burnup of this design was analyzed.},

They are based on the concept of a long‐life core reactor developed in Indonesia since early 1990 in collaboration with the Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors of the Tokyo Institute of Technology ({RLNR} {TITech}). The reactor cores are designed to have near zero (less then one effective delayed neutron fraction) burn‐up reactivity swing during the whole course of their operation to avoid a possibility of prompt criticality accident. The basic concept is that central region of the reactor core is filled with fertile (blanket) material. During the reactor operation fissile material accumulates in this central region, which helps to compensate fissile material loss in the peripheral core region and also contributes to negative coolant loss reactivity effect. A concept of high fuel volume fraction in the core is applied to achieve smaller size of a critical reactor. In this paper we consider to add Np‐237 to the fuel to enhance non proliferation characteristics of the systems. The effect of Np‐237 amount variation is discussed.},

Uranium and plutonium have been used for “new fuel” resources from {LWR} spent fuel as {MOX} fuel type which is loaded into thermal reactor or fast reactor types. Other actinides from the spent fuel such as neptunium, americium and curium as minor actinide ({MA}) are considered to be loaded into the reactors for specific purposes, recently. Those purposes such as for increasing protected plutonium production and breeding capability for protected plutonium as well as in the same time those amount of {MA} can be reduced to a small quantity as a burner or transmutation purpose. Some investigations and scientific approaches are performed in order to increase a material “barrier” in plutonium isotope composition by increasing the even mass number of plutonium isotope such as Pu‐238, Pu‐240 and Pu‐242 as plutonium protected composition. Higher material barrier which related to intrinsic properties of plutonium isotopes with even mass number (Pu‐238, Pu‐240 and Pu‐242), are recognized because of their intense decay heat ({DH}) and high spontaneous fission neutron ({SFN}) rates. Those even number mass of plutonium isotope contribute to some criteria of plutonium characterization which will be adopted for present study such as {IAEA}, Pellaud and Kessler criteria ({IAEA}, 1972; Pellaud, 2002; and Kessler, 2007). The present paper intends to evaluate the breeding capability as a fuel sustainability index of the reactors and to analyze the composition of protected plutonium production of large power reactor based on the {FaCT} {FBR} as reference (Ohki, et al., 2008). Three dimensional {FBR} core configuration has been adopted which is based on the core optimization calculation of {SRAC}‐{CITATION} code as reactor core analysis and {JENDL}‐3.3 is adopted for nuclear data library. Some {MA} doping materials are loaded into the blanket regions which can be considered as breeding region for protected plutonium production. Breeding capability of the reactor can be increased effectively by increasing {MA} doping rate while criticality condition of the reactor is reduced by doping {MA}. Adopting {MA} cycle is also effective to increase the isotopic Pu‐238 production in plutonium vector composition for denaturing purpose of plutonium.},

Its common problem is to find an optimum arrangement of fuel assemblies inside the reactor core. Main objective for this activity is to reduce the cost of generating electricity, which can be done by altering several physical properties of the nuclear reactor without violating any of the constraints imposed by operational and safety considerations. This research try to address the problem of nuclear fuel arrangement problem, which is, leads to the multi‐objective optimization problem. However, the calculation of the reactor core physical properties itself is a heavy computation, which became obstacle in solving the optimization problem by using genetic algorithm optimization.
This research tends to address that problem by using the emerging General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units ({GPGPU}) techniques implemented by C language for {CUDA} (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel programming. By using this parallel programming technique, we develop parallelized nuclear reactor fitness calculation, which is involving numerical finite difference computation.

The superiority of {BNCT} is that the radiation effects could be limited only for the tumor cells. {BNCT} radiation dose depends on the distribution of boron in the tumor. Absorbed dose to the cells from the reaction 10B (n, α) 7Li was calculated near interface medium containing boron and boron‐free region. The method considers the contribution of the alpha particle and recoiled lithium particle to the absorbed dose and the variation of Linear Energy Transfer ({LET}) charged particles energy. Geometrical factor data of boron distribution for the spherical surface is used to calculate the energy absorbed in the tumor cells, brain and scalp for case Glioblastoma Multiforme. The result shows that the optimal dose in tumor is obtained for boron concentrations of 22.1 mg 10B/g blood.},

The percentage depth dose of electron beams takes account not only on the value of electron’s energy, but also on the type of electron’s energy. The aims of this work are to carry on the effect of energy parameter of electron on the percentage depth dose of electron beam. Monte Carlo method is chosen in this project, due to the superior of this method for simulating the random process such as the transport particle in matter. The {DOSXYZnrc} usercode was used to simulate the electron transport in water phantom. Two aspects of electron’s energy parameter were investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. In the first aspect, electron energy’s value was varied also its spectrum. In the second aspect, the geometry of electron’s energy was taken account on. The parallel beam and the point source were chosen as the geometry of The measurements of percentage depth dose were conducted to compare with its simulation. The ionization chamber was used in these measurements. Presentation of the results of this work is given not only based on the shape of the percentage depth dose from the simulation and measurement, but also on the other aspect in its curve. The result of comparison between the simulation and its measurement shows that the shape of its curve depends on the energy value of electron and the type of its energy. The energy value of electron affected the depth maximum of dose.},

The weight of mercury in each cell of the plant is designed approximately 1700 kg. Radiotracer is prepared by mixing 203Hg radioactive mercury with 2400 g of inactive mercury in a bath. The respective precisely weighted mercury aliquots to be injected into the cells are prepared by pouring approximately 130 g of radioactive mercury taken from the bath into 13 standard vials, in accordance with the number of the cells tested. Four standard references prepared by further dilution of ±2 g active mercury taken from the bath to obtain the dilution factors range of 12,000 to 20,000 from which the calibration graph is constructed. The injection process is conducting by pouring the radioactive mercury from aliquots into the flowing mercury at the inlet side of the cell and allows them to mix thoroughly. It is assumed that the mass of the radiotracer injected into a closed system remains constant, at least during the period of the test. From this experiment it was observed that the mixing time is two days after injection of radioactive mercury. The inactive mercury in each electrolytic cell calculated by the radiotracer method is of the range 1351.529 kg to 1966.354 kg with maximum error (95\% confidence) is 1.52 \%. The accuracy of measurement of the present method is better than gravimetric one which accounts 4 \% of error on average.},

As an application, we apply this formalism to study cosmology. In respect to standard effective Friedmann equations on the brane, Lorentz invariance violation in the bulk causes a modification of this equations that can lead to significant physical consequences. In particular, the effective Friedmann equation on the brane explicitly depends on the equation of state of the brane matter and the Lorentz violating parameters. We show that the components of five-dimensional Weyl curvature are related to the matter on brane even at low energies. We also find that the constraints on the theory parameters are depend on the equation of state of the energy components of the brane matter.

	abstract = {Dynamical study of Trans-Neptunian Objects ({TNOs}) showed that the  orbital evolution of {TNOs}, especially for Scattered-Disk class, is closely related to Centaurs. As of 1 June 2009,  there were 673 known Centaurs and {TNOs} whose orbits are well-determined within an uncertainty of  6.4 /decade. It is interesting to investigate a fraction of evolving Centaurs and {TNOs} to inner solar system regions along 1 Myr evolution under perturbations of all planets. In order to have a  better knowledge about spatial distributions of Centaurs and {TNOs}, we generated additional four sets artificial data based on the known distribution. We find that most Centaurs show chaotic orbital evolutions and many of them are ejected out to the outer solar system. The ejected Centaurs in the first-half evolution are more numerous than that of the second-half one. This study also indicates that number of Centaurs originated from 3:2 Neptune resonance objects is more abundant at about 5  105 yr, and only {\textasciitilde}1\% Centaurs and {TNOs} evolve to be Mars-crossers.

Characterizations of poly(urethane-ester) were carried out by analysis of functional groups ({FTIR}), thermal properties ({DTA}/{TGA}), mechanical properties (Tensile tester), crystallinity ({XRD}), and biodegradability. The chain length of prepolymers used in polymerization has a significant effect in properties of poly(urethane-ester) as well as their biodegradability. The formation of poly(urethane-ester) was indicated by the presence of new absorption peaks at wave number of 3,348.2 and 1,596.9 cm−1 for urethane (–{NH}–) and aromatic groups in chain of polymers, respectively. The increase chain length of prepolymer used in polymerization with 4,4′-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) was observed the increase thermal property and crystallinity of poly(urethane-ester). However, the maximum mechanical property and also biodegradability in activated sludge were observed in poly(urethane-ester) prepared by polymerization of 4,4′-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) ({MDI}) and P({CL}-{DP}) prepolymers with {DP}/{CL} ratio of 1/20. Apparently, the amorphous parts of polymers are rapidly decomposed by enzymes of microorganisms, so the crystallinity on the whole of poly(urethane-ester) increases after incubation time of 30 days.},

The electron effective mass in the oxide and the electron phase velocity in the n+ poly-Si gate are the only two fitting parameters to compare calculated tunneling currents to measured ones.

Exponential and Airy wavefunctions were utilized to obtain the electron transmittance and the electron tunneling current. A transfer matrix method, as a numerical approach, was used as a benchmark to assess the analytical approaches. It was found that there is a similarity in the transmittances calculated among exponential- and Airy-wavefunction approaches and the {TMM} at low electron energies. However, for high energies, only the transmittance calculated by using the Airy-wavefunction approach is the same as that evaluated by the {TMM}. It was also found that only the tunneling currents calculated by using the Airy-wavefunction approach are the same as those obtained under the {TMM} for all range of oxide voltages. Therefore, a better analytical description for the tunneling phenomenon in the {MOS} capacitor is given by the Airy-wavefunction approach. Moreover, the tunneling current density decreases as the titanium concentration of the {TiN} x metal gate increases because the electron effective mass of {TiN} x decreases with increasing nitrogen concentration. In addition, the mass anisotropy cannot be neglected because the tunneling currents obtained under the isotropic and anisotropic masses are very different.},

We can connect the system (A, B, C) with its reciprocal system via the solutions of the Lyapunov equations. The realization of the reciprocal system is reduced by balanced truncation. This result is further translated using reciprocal transformation as the reduced -order model for the systems (A, B, C). Then the low order controller is designed based on the reduced order model.

Based on this theory we investigate the Kaluza-Klein two-brane-worlds cosmology at low energy, in both the static and the nonstatic internal dimensions. In the case of the static internal dimensions, the effective gravitational constant in the induced Friedmann equation depends on the equations of state of the brane matter, and the dark radiation term naturally appears. In the nonstatic case we take a relation between the external and internal scale factors of the form b(t)=aγ(t) in which the brane world evolves with two scale factors. In this case, the induced Friedmann equation on the brane is modified in the effective gravitational constant and the term proportional to a−4β. For dark radiation, we find γ=−2/(1+n). Finally, we discuss the issue of conformal frames which naturally arises with scalar-tensor theories. We find that the static internal dimensions in the Jordan frame may become nonstatic in the Einstein frame.},

In terms of their morphology, the grains from Jelekong are mostly octahedral and angular, which are similar to the general shapes of magnetic grains from the local soils. The grains from Sarimukti, on the other hand, are dominated by imperfect spherule shapes suggesting the product of combustion processes. Hysteresis parameters verify that the predominant magnetic mineral in leachate sludge is low coercivity ferrimagnetic mineral such as magnetite (Fe3O4). Furthermore, comparisons of rock magnetic parameters show that the magnetic minerals of soil samples from Jelekong have higher degree of magnetic pedogenesis indicating higher proportion of superparamagnetic/ultrafine particles than those of soil samples from Sarimukti.

It becomes monoclinic at T c = 200 K and back orthorhombic at T = 77 K. Spins order into the C-type antiferromagnetic structure below T N1 = 116 K and the order changes into the G-type antiferromagnetic structure below T N2 = 77 K.

Also by comparing the two single crystals spectra and previous studies in rare-earth manganites, high energy Raman active excitations are tentatively assigned.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been increasing demand on finding new solid electrolytes based on glassy material, due to their potential applications for solid state rechargeable battery. Superionic conducting glasses have many advantageous compared with the crystalline, or composite electrolytes, such as easy in preparation, low melting point, no grain broundary, wide composition range and easy to be formed as thin film. Among superionic glasses, the family of silver phosphate glasses ({AgI}) x ({AgPO} 3 ) 1- x  and lithium phosphate glasses ({LiI}) x ({LiPO} 3 ) 1- x , are the most interested materials to be investigated. Many experiments have been performed to investigate the properties of those materials. This paper will review the recent results of the lithium glasses ({LiI}) x ({LiPO} 3 ) 1- x , such as the preparation, appearance, structure, electrical, and thermal properties. The x-ray data shows the precipitate occured at  x =0.4, indicating the solubility limit of ({LiI}) x ({LiPO} 3 ) 1- x  was reached at this composition. The microstructure data observed by {SEM} showed the different area between the smooth surface for  x =0.3 and appearance of cluster at  x =0.4. Comparison between glassy {LiPO} 3  and ({LiI}) 0.3 ({LiPO} 3 ) 1- x  as the result of Raman spectra analysis, suggested a new feature at around 1000 cm -1 , indicating the depolymerization of the non bridging oxygen, due to the presence of {LiI} component. The room temperature conductivities of ({LiI}) x ({LiPO} 3 ) 1- x  with  x =0.3 and 0.4 are 2.7 ×10 -6  and 8.8 ×10 -7  S/cm, respectively, which are 3 orders of magnitudes higher than the undoped glass {LiPO} 3 . In general, the silver glass has better ionic conductivity than the lithium glass; but in application the lithium battery has better performance and produces higher voltage.},

	abstract = {A closed-loop temperature control system, which is composed of a thermal plant and a controller, has been developed to support undergraduate students in learning automatic control delivered in the Special Topics in Instrumentation Physics course. The thermal plant was made from a plastic box covering a lamp and a fan, which heats and drains the air in the plastic box, respectively, as well as a temperature sensor. The controller with a proportional control action was realized by employing the {PIC} 16F877 microcontroller. The control signal updates pulse-width modulators ({PWMs}) in which driver circuits turn on or off the lamp and the fan. A mathematical model of the closed-loop control system was derived and a theoretical transient response was then obtained. It is found that the experimental transient responses were always much lower than the set point and the steady-state errors were high for the proportional sensitivity ({KP}) lower than 10. For {KP} higher than 10, the transient responses tend to approach the set point to cause small steady-state errors. These characteristics are consistent with the theoretical transient response. Further examination revealed that the closed-loop system is a higher order system due to the action of the {PWMs} and the driver circuits. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This allows generation of synthetic μ-{CT} images of the rock model at arbitrary resolutions. Quantitative microstructure comparison based on Minkowski functionals, two-point correlation function and local porosity theory indicates that this modeling technique can provide more realistic and accurate models of sandstones than many existing techniques used currently.

The influence of several parameters ({pH}, alkyl chain length, concentration of the ion pair reagent) has been studied to determine the best chromatographic conditions. Methods: Separation of the three organotin compounds was achieved on a C8-bonded silica column using a mixture of methanol, water, and acetic acid (80:19:1) as eluent, containing 1 mmol/L decane sulfonic acid as ion pairing reagent. The eluates were detected on-line by hydride generation-quartz furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry ({HG}-{QFAAS}). Results: The resolving power of this developed method for separation of the organotins species at above conditions was shown by the values of fundamental chromatographic parameters. The capacity factors (k’) for {DBT}, {TBT} and {TPhT} species were 0.27, 2.54, and 5.92 respectively. Resolution (Rs) values for {DBT}-{TBT} and {TBT}-{TPhT} separation were 2.92 and 2.42 respectively, while the selectivity for {DBT}-{TBT} and {TBT}-{TPhT} were 9.76 and 3.50 respectively.

The difficulties associated with these experiments included the changes in physical properties of the gas mixture when temperature and pressure were varied. Changes in the relative humidity ({RH}) as a function of pressure and temperature also had a significant effect on the different behaviors of the mobility distributions of particles. In order to accomplish reliable measurement and minimize uncertainties, an integrated on-line control system was utilized. As the pressure decreased in a range of 500–980 {hPa}, the peak concentration of both ions and nanometer-sized particles decreased, which suggests that higher pressure tended to enhance the growth of particles nucleated by ion-induced nucleation. Moreover, the modal diameters of the measured particle size distributions showed a systematic shift to larger sizes with increasing pressure. However, in the temperature range of 5–20 °C, temperature increases had no significant effects on the mobility distribution of particles. The effects of residence time, {RH} (7\%–70\%), and {SO}2 concentration (0.08–6.7 ppm) on ion-induced nucleation were also systematically investigated. The results show that the nucleation and growth were significantly dependent on the residence time, {RH}, and {SO}2 concentration, which is in agreement with both a previous model and previous observations. This research will be inevitable for a better understanding of the role of ions in an atmospheric nucleation mechanism.},

The particles were synthesized from the reaction of {MgCl}2 and {NH}4F in an aqueous solution at 75 °C for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. Control of particle size was accomplished mainly by changing the concentration of the reactants, which could be qualitatively explained by conventional nucleation theory. Flexibility of the process in controlling particle morphology, from a spherical to a cubical form, was predominantly achieved by varying the concentration of {MgCl}2. Since the same {XRD} pattern was detected in particles with varying morphologies, the shape transformation was due to changes in particle growth. With the ability to control particle size and morphology, the creation of other inorganic particles is possible and has potential for many field applications.},

The gratings were fabricated by interference laser technique by employing Lloyd's mirror configuration. The Atomic Force Microscopy ({AFM}) image shows the formation of corrugated grating structure. Although the grating depth is relatively shallow compared to the thickness of the layer, the photo-pumped lasing action has been observed in those structures.

A mesostructured silica−surfactant composite was formed at the early stage of the reaction, and zeolite crystallization proceeded during subsequent hydrothermal treatment. The scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) and transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) observations of the crystallized products showed that micro- and mesopores were hierarchically assembled in unique particle morphology with rugged surfaces. Solid-state 29Si and 13C {NMR} revealed that the covalent bonds between the zeolite framework and mesopore-directing agent were present in the products before calcination. The use of nonsilylated alkyl poly(oxyethylene ether) or a silylated alkytrimethyl-ammonium-type cationic surfactant for the synthesis of silicalite-1 resulted in a mixture of mesoporous silica and zeolite as the final product, which suggests that the covalent interaction and nonelectrostatic charge matching interaction favor the formation of hierarchically mesoporous siliceous zeolite. This alkoxysilylated nonionic surfactant can also be extended to synthesize aluminosilicate {MFI} zeolite ({ZSM}-5).},

Parameters optimization of flexible structure system becomes an {HÂ}¿-output feedback problem. This problem is transformed to Bilinear Matrix Inequality problem and then it is solved by using {GA}. The {GA} is distinguished by their parallel investigation of several areas of a search space simultaneously to locate a global extreme by manipulating a population with randomized operators.

It depends on three parameters: theaverage length of the infective period, the contact parameter, and the density ofsusceptible population at the initial time. With di®usive terms in the model, thespatial spread of the infection is obvious. Threshold number greater than one isalso the necessary condition for the spreading of infection in the form of a travelingpulse. Its minimum velocity can be determined. We implement the {MacCormackmethod}, and simulate the generation of a traveling pulse starting from one infectedbird.

The main goal is to determine the optimum gas injection rate for each well that maximizing the total oil production rate. The total gas for injection is constrained by the maximum availability and the total liquid production rate is constrained by separator capacity. The mathematical model for gas lift problem could be written as a boundary value problem, where the two parameter family non linear differential equation of the boundary value problem represents steady flow equation along the tubing, satisfying wellhead pressure and bottom hole pressure as boundary conditions. Oil production rate is a non-linear function of gas injection rate, which is given implicitly from the gas lift model. A computation scheme based on genetic algorithms is developed to solve the constrained optimization problem with and without considering separator capacity. Our results show quite good estimation for optimum solution. This approach is also flexible to accommodate separator capacity constraints.},

Furthermore, the communication between residues belonged to the 3'→5' exonuclease domain appeared as correlated motion, in contrast to the residues inside 5'→3' polymerase domain represented by thumb and fingers subdomains showed anticorrelated motion. In addition, the surface electrostatic potential analysis showed that the interface between thumb and fingers subdomains has positive charges, this might due to caused repulsion of the subdomains resulting periodical motion even without substrates.},

Sweet potato crops were cultivated in soil contaminated by 134Cs\&nbsp;with concentration of 167.62 Bq/g as well as in non-contaminated soil as control. The 134Cs\&nbsp;activity concentrations of leaves, stems, roots, tubers and the whole plant were determined every week up to 16 weeks. \&nbsp;134Cs activity concentrations of soil in root zone and outside root zone were also determined. The maximum transfer factor for the whole sweet potato plants takes place at the second week with {TF} value of 1.277. The maximum {TF} value for each parts are roots (18.448), tubbers (13.153), stems (1.241), and leaves (0.746). Annual equivalent dose was calculated based on the activity of sweet potato plants at harvest time. This research obtained annual internal radiation dose from consumption of sweet potatoes contaminated by 134Cs\&nbsp;of 0.0185 {mSv}/year. This value compared with average annual dose limits recommended by {BAPETEN}, {IAEA} and {ICRP} respectively was 0.14\%, 0.37\%, and 0.19\%.},

In the present study, a local blockage accident analysis of Pb-Bi-cooled long-life fast reactors has been performed. In this analysis, we consider two models. In the first model, we consider that the cross-flow can only come from two nearby channels. In the second model, we consider that the cross-flow can come from four nearby channels. The results show that for the present long-life Pb-Bi reactors which are of medium power density level, local blockage will increase the coolant, cladding and pellet temperatures but still within their limits.},

We discuss fluid flow between two stationary parallel plates. By applying a constant pressure gradient, volumetric flux was determined as a function of time until a steady condition is achieved. For steady laminar flow, its velocity profile is parabolic. For flow in porous media between two stationary parallel plates, the results show that medium permeability depends on porosity and obstacle configurations. For a single obstacle, the permeability is a parabolic function with respect to positions of an obstacle in the direction perpendicular to the flow. The permeability is smallest when the obstacle is at the central line along the flow. A maximum permeability may be achieved when the obstacles attached to the channel wall. Other obstacle structures give lower permeability, even zero permeability for dead end microchannels.},

As initial fuel composition some composition of light water reactor ({LWR}) spent fuels are used and loaded into the such as mixed oxide ({MOX}) in the core regions and minor actinide doping is loaded into blanket regions. It is shows that criticality condition as indicating reactor operation time is obtained less for loading {MA} case in the blanket regions in comparing with no loading {MA}. It indicates a shorter reactor operation time is obtained for loading {MA} than without loading {MA}. Conversion rasio level or breeding rasio, is obtained less conversion rasio for loading {MA} which shows less fissile material production when some portion of U-238 is replaced by {MA} loading. Although, during reactor operation, some fissile plutonium materials such as Pu-239 are also produced from {MA} loading, however, it still less production in comparing with fissile plutonium production from direct process from converted U-238. It shows more Pu-238 can be produced than Pu-240 because of main portion of {MA} is Np-237 which can be directly produce more Pu-238 than Pu- 240. As protected plutonium composition (Pu-238 and Pu-240), loading {MA} produces some even mass plutonium isotopes in the blanket regions and loading 5 \% of {MA} doping, obtains more than enough composition based on Kessler’criterion to estimate the level of technical difficulty for contructing explosive nuclear devices based on internal heating of Pu-238.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fuel materials from spent fuel of light water reactors have a potential to be used for destructive devices with very huge energy release or in the same time, it can be utilized as a peaceful energy or civil applications, for generating electricity, desalination of water, medical application and others applications. Several research activities showed some recycled spent fuel can be used as additional fuel loading for increasing fuel breeding capability as well as improving intrinsic aspect of nuclear non-proliferation. The present investigation intends to evaluate the composition of heavy metals inventories and fuel breeding capability in the {FBR} design based on the loaded fuel of light water reactor ({LWR}) spent fuel ({SF}) of 33 {GWd}/t with 5 years cooling time by adopting depletion code of {ORIGEN}. Whole core analysis of {FBR} design is performed by adopting and coupling codes such as {SLAROM} code, {JOINT} and {CITATION} codes. Nuclear data library, {JFS}-3-J-3.2R which is based on the {JENDL} 3.2 has been used for nuclear data analysis. {JSFR} design is the basis design reference which basically adopted 800 days cycle length for 4 batches system. Higher inventories of plutonium of {MOX} fuel and {TRU} fuel types at equilibrium composition than initial composition have been shown. Minor actinide ({MA}) inventory compositions obtain a different inventory trends at equilibrium composition for both fuel types. Higher Inventory of {MA} is obtained by {MOX} fuel and less {MA} inventory for {TRU} fuel at equilibrium composition than initial composition. Some different {MA} inventories can be estimated from the different inventory trend of americium (Am). Higher americium inventory for {MOX} fuel and less americium inventory for {TRU} fuel at equilibrium condition. Breeding ratio of {TRU} fuel is relatively higher compared with {MOX} fuel type. It can be estimated from relatively higher production of Pu-238 (through converted {MA}) in {TRU} fuel, and Pu-238 converts through neutron capture to produce Pu-239. Higher breeding ratio of {MOX} fuel and {TRU} fuel types at equilibrium condition are estimated from converted fertile material during reactor operation into fissile material of plutonium such as converted uranium fuel (converted U-238 into Pu-239) or additional converted fuel from {MA} into Pu-238 and changes into Pu-239 by capturing neutron. Loading {LWR} {SF} gives better fuel breeding capability and increase inventory of {MA} for doping material of {MOX} fuel; however, it requires more supply {MA} inventory for {TRU} fuel type.},

	abstract = {Some interesting issues are attributed to nuclide compositions of spent fuels from thermal reactors as well as fast reactors such as a potential to reuse as recycled fuel, and a possible capability to be manage as a fuel for destructive devices. In addition, analysis on nuclear forensics which is related to spent fuel compositions becomes one of the interesting topics to evaluate the origin and the composition of spent fuels from the spent fuel foot-prints. Spent fuel compositions of different fuel types give some typical spent fuel foot prints and can be estimated the origin of source of those spent fuel compositions. Some technics or methods have been developing based on some science and technological capability including experimental and modeling or theoretical aspects of analyses. Some foot-print of nuclear forensics will identify the typical information of spent fuel compositions such as enrichment information, burnup or irradiation time, reactor types as well as the cooling time which is related to the age of spent fuels. This paper intends to evaluate the typical spent fuel compositions of light water ({LWR}) and fast breeder reactors ({FBR}) from the view point of some foot prints of nuclear forensics. An established depletion code of {ORIGEN} is adopted to analyze {LWR} spent fuel ({SF}) for several burnup constants and decay times. For analyzing some spent fuel compositions of {FBR}, some coupling codes such as {SLAROM} code, {JOINT} and {CITATION} codes including {JFS}-3-J-3.2R as nuclear data library have been adopted. Enriched U-235 fuel composition of oxide type is used for fresh fuel of {LWR} and a mixed oxide fuel ({MOX}) for {FBR} fresh fuel. Those {MOX} fuels of {FBR} come from the spent fuels of {LWR}. Some typical spent fuels from both {LWR} and {FBR} will be compared to distinguish some typical foot-prints of {SF} based on nuclear forensic analysis.},

Each fuel core regions are subdivided into ten parts (region-1 until region-10) with the same volume in the axial direction. The fresh Natural Uranium initially put in region-1, after one cycle of 10 years of burn-up it is shifted to region-2 and the each region-1 filled by fresh Natural Uranium.

Recycling after reprocessing is one of the options for dealing with nuclear reactor spent fuel. Reprocessing is very costly and needs remote handling since spent fuel is very hazard high level waste. On top of that, only a small number of countries can manage a reprocessing plant. If country likes Indonesia decide to "go nuclear", it should find another way to deal with the nuclear spent fuel. Korea has proposed the {DUPIC} (Direct Utilization of Spent {PWR} fuel In {CANDU}) concept. Nevertheless, {DUPIC} concept requires two types of nuclear power plants, i.e., pressurized water reactor ({PWR}) and {CANadian} Deuterium Uranium reactor ({CANDU}). In this study, we evaluate a scheme of direct recycling of spent {BWR} fuel in {BWR} system, under the concept that we have called as a {SUPEL} (Straight Utilization of {sPEnt} {LWR} fuel in {LWR} system) scenario. Several spent {BWR} fuel compositions in loaded {BWR} fuel has been evaluated to achieve the criticality of reactor.},

In this decade, depth imaging becomes important tools for producing accurate image in depth imaging instead of time domain imaging. The challenge of depth migration method, however, is in revealing the complex structure of subsurface. There are many methods of depth migration with their advantages and weaknesses. In this paper, we show our propose method of pre-stack depth migration based on time domain inverse scattering wave equation. Hopefully this method can be as solution for imaging complex structure in Indonesia, especially in rich thrusting fault zones. In this research, we develop a recent advance wave equation migration based on time domain inverse scattering wave which use more natural wave propagation using scattering wave. This wave equation pre-stack depth migration use time domain inverse scattering wave equation based on Helmholtz equation. To provide true amplitude recovery, an inverse of divergence procedure and recovering transmission loss are considered of pre-stack migration. Benchmarking the propose inverse scattering pre-stack depth migration with the other migration methods are also presented, i.e.: wave equation pre-stack depth migration, waveequation depth migration, and pre-stack time migration method. This inverse scattering pre-stack depth migration could image successfully the rich fault zone which consist extremely dip and resulting superior quality of seismic image. The image quality of inverse scattering migration is much better than the others migration methods.},

The main advantage of Kalman filtering is capability of technique to handling continually time varying models and has high resolution capabilities. In this work, we use discrete Kalman filter that it was combined with primitive deconvolution. Filtering process works on reflectivity function, hence the work flow of filtering is started with primitive deconvolution using inverse of wavelet. The seismic signals then are obtained by convoluting of filtered reflectivity function with energy waveform which is referred to as the seismic wavelet.

Therefore, wave propagation phenomena in pore media is important to be studied. By referring this study, in-direct pore measurement method based on seismic wave propagation can be developed. Porosity play important role in reservoir, because the porosity can be as compartment of fluid. Many type of porosity like primary as well as secondary porosity. Carbonate rock consist many type of porosity, i.e.: inter granular porosity, moldic porosity and also fracture porosity. The complexity of pore type in carbonate rocks make the wave propagation in these rocks is more complex than sand reservoir. We have studied numerically wave propagation in carbonate rock by finite difference modeling in time-space domain. The medium of wave propagation was modeled by base on the result of pattern recognition using artificial neural network. The image of thin slice of carbonate rock is then translated into the velocity matrix. Each mineral contents including pore of thin slice image are translated to velocity since mineral has unique velocity. After matrix velocity model has been developed, the seismic wave is propagated numerically in this model. The phenomena diffraction is clearly shown while wave propagates in this complex carbonate medium. The seismic wave is modeled in various frequencies. The result shows dispersive phenomena where high frequency wave tends to propagate in matrix instead pores. In the other hand, the low frequency waves tend to propagate through pore space even though the velocity of pore is very low. Therefore, this dispersive phenomena of seismic wave propagation can be the future indirect measurement technology for predicting the existence or intensity of pore space in reservoir rock. It will be very useful for the future reservoir characterization.},

Changes in subsurface condition are related to the deformation of magma chamber or dynamic of the associated hydrothermal. The inversion scheme was applied to synthetic data and yielded acceptable results. Since currently we have no field data, the implementation to real data was conducted by applying the scheme to microgravity data recorded at Merapi volcano during 1993-1995 activity published by Jousset et al. in 2000 [1] and Gunawan [2] . The interpreted gravity anomaly indicates that a causative body which depth and dimension are comparable to those concluded from seismic survey (depth 2000 m and 600-800 m radius) was the caused of the anomaly.

	abstract = {Magnetotelluric ({MT}) is one of the geophysical methods which are used in mapping subsurface resistivity distribution of the earth by utilizing electromagnetic ({EM}) wave as an energy source. Through the measurement of electric and magnetic field in orthogonal direction above the surface of the earth, resistivity distribution of the subsurface can be mapped while the penetration depth depends on the frequency of the {EM} wave. In many cases, three-dimensional resistivity structures are often approximated by two-dimensional models without checking the dimensionality of the structure prior to perform modeling. However, such approximation can be misleading if the structure is purely 3D where electromagnetic fields can not be separated into {TE} and {TM} modes. To overcome this problem, a dimensionality analysis is important in order to get the general feature of the structure in particular in 3D structure as expected in volcanic area. There are many methods to analyze dimensionality of the resistivity structure such as Bahr’s method and Groom-Bailey decompositions, which assume that the regional structure is two-dimensional. Here, we examine the dimensionality analyses using the phase tensor and induction vector, which is no assumption of two-dimensional for regional structure. The parameter “beta” is also used as an index of three-dimensionality of the structure. The resistivity value and area of the synthetic model were made as close as possible to the real volcanic structure in order to confirm the ability of this method in volcanic region. We also applied this method to the real magnetotelluric data collected from volcanic zone. The result shows that the volcanic region is electrically dominated by 3D structure at shallow part where conductive zone with circle-like shape exists in the middle of the model. The pure 2D structure was found at the deep part of the model.},

With the length of 1900 km, Sumatran fault was divided into 20 segments starting from the southernmost Sumatra Island having small slip rate and increasing to the north end of Sumatra Island. There are several geophysical methods to analyze fault structure depending on physical parameter used in these methods, such as seismology, geodesy and electromagnetic. Magnetotelluric method which is one of geophysical methods has been widely used in mapping and sounding resistivity distribution because it does not only has the ability for detecting contras resistivity but also has a penetration range up to hundreds of kilometers. Magnetotelluric survey was carried out in Aceh region with the 12 total sites crossing Sumatran Fault on Aceh and Seulimeum segments. Two components of electric and magnetic fields were recorded during 10 hours in average with the frequency range from 320 Hz to 0,01 Hz. Analysis of the pseudosection of phase and apparent resistivity exhibit vertical low phase flanked on the west and east by high phase describing the existence of resistivity contras in this region. Having rotated the data to N45°E direction, interpretation of the result has been performed using three different methods of 1D {MT} modeling i.e. Bostick inversion, 1D {MT} inversion of {TM} data, and 1D {MT} inversion of the impedance determinant. By comparison, we concluded that the use of {TM} data only and the impedance determinant in 1D inversion yield the more reliable resistivity structure of the fault compare to other methods. Based on this result, it has been shown clearly that Sumatra Fault is characterized by vertical contras resistivity indicating the existence of Aceh and Seulimeum faults which has a good agreement with the geological data.},

Magnetotelluric measurement was designed using a grid system with the 30 sites and interval station of approximately 250m covering the summit area.

Magnetic and gravity data were acquired in the summit area overlapping with the {MT} survey to determine basement of the volcano structure. The shallow resistivity structure was constrained by two lines {DC} resistivity survey that was carried out in east-west direction located in the center of the summit to confirm the thickness of pyroclastic distribution released from 2002 eruption. The {MT} result derived from 3D inversion shows that the resistive zone of deep structure with the circle-like shape exists in the middle of the model in coincidence with the location of new craters. A comparison of low total magnetic field appear to be consistent with the circle-like shaped resistive zone presumably related to high temperature distributed in center of the region.

	abstract = {Vibration like an earthquake is a phenomenon of physics. The characteristics of these vibrations can be used as an early warning system so as to reduce the loss or damage caused by earthquakes. In this paper, we introduced a new type of low frequency 2D vibration sensor based on flat coil element that we have developed. Its working principle is based on position change of a seismic mass that put in front of a flat coil element. The flat coil is a part of a {LC} oscillator; therefore, the change of seismic mass position will change its resonance frequency. The results of measurements of low frequency vibration sensor in the direction of the x axis and y axis gives the frequency range between 0.2 to 1.0 Hz.},

There are three high-k material simulated in this paper, {HfO}2, {ZrO}2, and Y2O3. As we know that high-Κ material is used nowadays to reduce leakage current, so this paper demonstrates the application of high-Κ material to reduce leakage current in non-volatile memory quantum dot based floating gate {MOSFET}. Simulation results of this paper show the leakage current can be suppressed by using high-Κ material as tunnel oxide up to 10 times. Furthermore, this paper also shows that the memory performance can be properly sustained. The writing and erasing time are depend on tunneling current probability which calculated using transfer matrix method. The writing time and erasing time for {HfO}2 and {ZrO}2 are 150 nanosecond and 15 nanosecond.},

The performance of {SiGe} with 50\% of Germanium composition will be compared with pure Silicon and pure Germanium while the variations of quantum dot size used are 1nm, 2nm, 3nm and 4nm. Simulation results show that increasing numbers of Germanium atoms within the material combined with larger size of quantum dot leads to higher generation rate and helps broadening the range of photon energy which can contribute on the creation of electron-hole pair.

High-spatial-resolution meteorological satellite data acquired from Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5 ({GMS} 5), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 9 ({GOES} 9) and Multi-functional Transport Satellite-1R ({MTSAT}-1R) are used to derive yearly average clear fractions over various regions of Indonesia. This parameter is determined from temperature measurements in the {IR}3 channel (water vapour, 6.7 μm) for high-altitude clouds (cirrus), and from the {IR}1 channel (10.7 μm) for lower-altitude clouds. An algorithm is developed to detect the corresponding clouds. The results of this study were used to select the best possible sites in Indonesia, which will be analysed further by performing in situ measurements in the future. The results suggest that regions of East Nusa Tenggara, located in southeastern Indonesia, are the most promising candidates for such an astronomical site. The yearly clear sky fraction of this region may reach better than 70 per cent, with an uncertainty of 10 per cent.},

	abstract = {On February 2012, two stellar occultation's by large Trans-neptunian 
Objects ({TNO}'s) were observed by our group. On the 3rd, an event by
(208996) 2003 {AZ}84 was recorded from Mont Abu Observatory and {IUCAA}
Girawali Observatory in India and from Weizmann Observatory in Israel.
On the 17th, a stellar occultation by (50000) Quaoar was observed from
south France and Switzerland. Both occultations are the second observed
by our group for each object, and will be used to improve the results
obtained on the previous events. The occultation by 2003 {AZ}84 is the
first multi-chord event recorded for this object. From the single chord
event on January 8th 2011, Braga-Ribas et al. 2011 obtained a lower
limit of 573 +/- 21 km. From the 2012 occultation the longest chord has
a size of 662 +/- 50 km. The other chords will permit to determine the
size and shape of the {TNO}, and derive other physical parameters, such as
the geometric albedo. The Quaoar occultation was observed from south of
France (Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, {TAROT} telescope and
Valensole) and from Gnosca, Switzerland. Unfortunately, all three sites
in France are almost at the same Quaoar's latitude, so in practice, we
have two chords that can be used to fit Quaoar's limb. The resulting fit
will be compared with the results obtained by Braga-Ribas et al. 2011.

The research project will study and develop some additional observing tools, image acquisition and image processing procedures for mobile and robotic observing system that one enable to search the very young crescent in broad daylight. The main problem is how to minimize the atmospheric and instrumental stray light that can obscure the information from the very young crescent image from the daylight background. We have developed and tested a simple extended telescope baffle that can reduce the incoming stray light from the sky and environment. Hence, it will increase the contrast of the lunar crescent.

The pendulum position is converted into a signal frequency by employing a simple electronic circuit that detects the intensity of infrared light reflected by the pendulum. The signal produced by the electronic circuit is sent to the microphone port and recorded as a 16-bit wave file by common software. The wave file is then processed to obtain the signal period as a function of time by timing all zero crossings. From the obtained signal period as a function of time, an average value of the period is calculated. Using the calculated average period, it was found that the gravitational acceleration is (9.77 ± 0.03) m s −2 . Noting that the G-type La Coste \& Romberg G928 gravimeter obtains a gravitational acceleration of 9.78 m s −2 , the present method offers very good accuracy, with a percentage error of about 0.1\%.},

The structure parameters to be varied in this work consist of the number of the grating teeth (N) and the grating groove depth (g). It is found that those parameters exhibit roughly linear and mostly monotonous variations at the lower resonance. The reduction of the group velocity and enhancement of energy confinement are also shown to be effectively attained by increasing N, while leaving the loss parameter relatively unaffected. On the other hand, the calculated results for the upper resonance wavelength are shown to exhibit consistently non-monotonous responses to increasing g. Similarly distinct behaviors are also found in the relationship between the minimum group velocity (vg, min) and the energy loss (L) as well as that between vg, min and the confined energy (W) for various N and g at the upper resonances. This peculiarly different behaviors are shown to be related to the variations of the associated local density of states with respect to N and g calculated for the upper resonance.},

	abstract = {A numerical study is performed on photonic band gap of 2D square lattice photonic crystal with varied layered dielectric rods by using the plane wave expansion method for the purpose of investigating the effects of geometrical and permittivity variations. The results show that in general the {TE} and {TM} band gaps do not coexist in the band structure of this layered rods system. However, for a specific choice of the system parameters leading to a photonic crystals of hollow dielectric rods, both {TE} and {TM} photonic band structures feature perceptible band gaps with significant overlap, yielding effective complete photonic band gaps ({CPBG}). The study further shows that the {CPBG} can be enlarged by varying both radii of the hollow rods. It is found that a large {CPBG} can be attained which is comparable in size with those found in hexagonal lattice photonic crystal of air holes as well as square lattice photonic crystal rods incorporating dielectric veins.},

We find that the frustration of Wannier’s Ising model on the triangular lattice is imprinted in a nanostructured honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ ions that resists a coherent static Jahn-Teller distortion. The resulting two-dimensional random-bond spin-1/2 system on the honeycomb lattice has a broad spectrum of spin-dimer–like excitations and low-energy spin degrees of freedom that retain overall hexagonal symmetry.

Separating thermal and nonthermal contributions to the optical transients, we show that the total spectral weight of the two lowest peaks is conserved, demonstrating that both excitations correspond to the same multiplet. The pump-induced transfer of spectral weight between the two peaks reveals that the low-energy one is a Hubbard exciton, i.e., a resonance or a nearly bound state between a doublon and a holon. Finally, we speculate that the pump-driven spin disorder can be used to quantify the kinetic energy gain of the excitons in a ferromagnetic environment.},

The effect of the grating was investigated by angle-resolved reflection and emission spectroscopy performed on the thin film samples with and without the grating. Incident light of both s- and p-polarizations were considered in this experiment and the measurement was performed in the reflection and the photoluminescence modes as well. The results exhibit remarkable resonant effect of photoluminescence enhancement over those observed from the sample with planar silver coating for both incident light polarizations. The much larger enhancement factor of {\textasciitilde}50.0 found for the case of p-polarized light can be attributed to the combined contributions of surface plasmon polariton enhanced absorption of excitation light and the resonant coupling between the {SPP} and the fluorophore, while only the latter was operating in the case of s-polarized incident light which showed a smaller enhancement factor of 6.0.},

The very large intensity enhancement is obtained over those detected with single pulse operation without generating the He plasma. It is most remarkable that the same sharpness and intensity enhancement observed in the previous double pulse experiment with 37mJ laser ablation energy is achieved in the present experiment with much lower ablation energy of merely 2.5mJ, resulting in average crater size of about 10μm in diameter. Further, a linear relation is obtained between the Cl concentration and its emission intensity in alumina samples, while an estimated limit of detection of 80ppm is obtained by using concrete sample, which is adequate for highly sensitive quantitative Cl analysis in concrete.},

	abstract = {A crucial safety measure to be strictly observed in the operation of heavy-water nuclear power plants is the mandatory regular inspection of the concentration of deuterium penetrated into the zircaloy fuel vessels. The existing standard method requires a tedious, destructive, and costly sample preparation process involving the removal of the remaining fuel in the vessel and melting away part of the zircaloy pipe. An alternative method of orthogonal dual-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectrometry ({LIBS}) is proposed by employing flowing atmospheric helium gas without the use of a sample chamber. The special setup of ps and ns laser systems, operated for the separate ablation of the sample target and the generation of helium gas plasma, respectively, with properly controlled relative timing, has succeeded in producing the desired sharp D I 656.10 nm emission line with effective suppression of the interfering H I 656.28 nm emission by operating the ps ablation laser at very low output energy of 26 {mJ} and 1 μs ahead of the helium plasma generation. Under this optimal experimental condition, a linear calibration line is attained with practically zero intercept and a 20 μg/g detection limit for D analysis of zircaloy sample while creating a crater only 10 μm in diameter. Therefore, this method promises its potential application for the practical, in situ, and virtually nondestructive quantitative microarea analysis of D, thereby supporting the more-efficient operation and maintenance of heavy-water nuclear power plants. Furthermore, it will also meet the anticipated needs of future nuclear fusion power plants, as well as other important fields of application in the foreseeable future.},

One promising low-cost material for manufacturing porous ceramics as water filter is clay. Clays can be blended with other materials such as polymers to obtain functional ceramic materials. Approach: Ceramic wastewater filters were fabricated from clay using both sol-gel and simple mixing methods followed by hot-pressing and calcination. Polyethylene Glycol ({PEG}) was used as a poreforming agent. Results: Varying the clay:{PEG} ratio modified the membrane permeability between 1.65×10 -16 m 2 and 3.16×10 -15 m 2 for the sol-gel membranes and between 1.38×10 -16 and 8.72×10 -13 m 2 for membranes prepared by simple mixing. The strength ranged from 0.28 {MPa}-1.71 {MPa} for the sol-gel membranes and from 0.05-0.90 {MPa} for samples prepared by simple mixing. The filtration performance was tested using aqueous solutions of Methylene Blue ({MB}). The concentrations of {MB} remaining in the solution varied from 0.98-1.44\% for sol-gel filters and from 1.50-38.05\% for filters prepared by simple mixing. Conclusion: We succeeded in making ceramic as filter from clay. The porous ceramic can be used to reducing concentration of pollutant simulated. The model introduced has succeeded to explain the experimental observations with percolation approximation.},

The transmittance was then applied to calculate tunneling currents in {TiN}/{HfSiOxN}/{SiO}2/p-Si {MOS} capacitors. The calculated results show that as the gate electron velocity increases, the transmittance decreases and therefore the tunneling current reduces. The tunneling current becomes lower as the equivalent oxide thickness ({EOT}) of {HfSiOxN} layer increases. When the incident electron passed through the barriers in the normal incident to the interface, the electron tunneling process becomes easier. It was also shown that the tunneling current was independent of the substrate orientation. Moreover, the model could be used in designing high speed {MOS} devices with low tunneling currents.},

Proc. 1284, 154 (2010); 1415, 163 (2011); {IJBAS}/{IJENS} 11, 15 (2011)]. We also identified that both current and temperature influence the morphology of the metal bridges and efficiency of the solar cell.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Problem statement: Pollutions of water bodies by dye wastes from textile industries and other sources have become critical consideration. A photocatalytic technique using semiconductor materials such as Titanium Dioxide ({TiO} 2) activated by lights has been considered as one economical method to solve this problem. Approach: We attached titanium dioxide on the surface of polymer grains as photocatalyc agents using a cylinder milling method. Photodegradation processes were observed in decomposition of Methylene Blue ({MB}) solutions, as waste model, under solar illumination. Several parameters were optimized such as the milling temperature, the milling period, number of coated grain layers on the surface of the waste. The repeatability of using the coated grains was also sipected. Results: Two layers of {TiO} 2 coated grains resulted the optimum decomposition rate of the {MB} solution. The milling temperature of 100°C and the milling period of 90 min produced the optimal decomposition rate. After five times repetition, the {TiO} 2 coated grains still function well by decomposition up to 97\% {MB} compound. Conclusion: These materials have the potential in large scale wastewater treatment in the tropical regions and nearly do not require a complicated late handling in the process of separating the catalyst for treated water as well as requires very small energy, expect the sunlight energy.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamic simulation on iron in high-temperature molten lead-bismuth eutectic has been carried out to investigate the iron corrosion and its mitigation. The aim of the work is to investigate the corrosion and evaluate proper oxygen content of injection for significant and effective reduction. To study the phenomena we calculated the diffusion coefficients, radial distribution functions and mean square displacement of iron, and also observed the micro-structure of iron before and after oxygen injection into coolant. The present calculation shows that a significant and effective reduction of corrosion can be achieved by injection of 7.68 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}-1.55 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} wt{\textbackslash}\% into coolant at temperature 750 °C. It is predicted that the lower limit of oxygen content, 7.68 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} wt{\textbackslash}\%, is the minimum value to develop a self-healing stable protective oxide film for preventing high dissolution of iron; and that the upper limit of oxygen content, 1.55 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} wt{\textbackslash}\%, is the maximum value in order to avoid the precipitation of coolant oxides. By injection of 7.68 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} wt{\textbackslash}\% of oxygen, the corrosion rate has been reduced about 92.16{\textbackslash}\% at 750 °C, and reduced by 98.66{\textbackslash}\% at the lower temperature 550 °C, compared with the normal, oxygenless condition.},

In this study the gas cooled reactor system is combined with modified {CANDLE} burn-up scheme to create long life fast reactors with natural uranium as fuel cycle input. Such a system can utilize natural uranium resources efficiently without the necessity of enrichment plant or reprocessing plant. Therefore, by using this type of nuclear power plants optimum nuclear energy utilization, including in developing countries, can be easily obtained without the problem of nuclear proliferation. In this paper, a design study of 800MWt long-life gas cooled fast reactors with natural uranium as fuel cycle input has been performed. Due to the thermal hydraulic constraints, the average power density of the proposed design is limited to 70W/cc. The system has excellent performance and is at least comparable to that of Pb–Bi cooled system. The average discharge burn-up is about 258GWd/ton {HM}.},

The burnup code was facilitated with the calculation method for determining the required 233U concentration for criticality of the system inherently. The code was coupled with {SRAC} 2002 cell calculation code to compose a time independent-cell burnup code. In the cell calculation, 26 {HMs}, 66 fission products ({FPs}) and one pseudo {FP} have been utilized. The {JENDL} 3.2 library has been employed in this study. The results show that the profile of the required 233U concentration for criticality depends on the neutron spectra and the microscopic cross-section. However, the profile of the conversion ratio likely depends on the number density of heavy nuclides.},

In our previous study, we presented an innovative design for simplifying a pebble bed reactor, and the optimization of this design showed that burnup values could be increased and natural uranium uses could be reduced. The purposes of the current study were to design a simplified pebble bed reactor by removing the unloading device from the reactor system and to further optimize the burnup characteristics of this reactor with a peu à peu fuel-loading scheme by introducing thorium in the fuel configuration as a fertile material. Another goal was to optimize the fuel composition so that the system could achieve even better burnup characteristics and use scarce uranium resources more efficiently. Using a specially developed computer code, we analyzed and optimized the performance of a 110-{MWt} simplified pebble bed reactor using a peu à peu fuel-loading scheme. An optimized design using 30\% of fertile thorium mixed with uranium fuel with 15\% 235U enrichment and a 7\% packing fraction calculated to achieve a high burnup of 140 {GWD}/T for more than 21 years' operation time that could save 13 to 33\% of natural uranium use compared with the savings noted in our previous study. Neutronic, burnup and fuel economic analysis for this optimized design are discussed in this study.},

Experiments were conducted using a modified continuous flow gas-generation system employing a soft X-ray ionizer and a particle counter, with an improved integrated online temperature, pressure and a relative humidity ({RH}) control system. Nucleation rates were measured as a function of {SO}2 concentration at different levels of {RH}, pressure (600–970hPa) and temperature (5–25°C). The results show that the nucleation rate dependence on {SO}2 concentration followed a power law, and the slope varied slightly in a range from 1 to 1.26 at different {RH} levels (15–60\%). A positive pressure effect was generally found and a power law was followed with varied scaling for different {SO}2 concentrations. The trend of an increase in nucleation rate with temperature was consistent with observations in homogenous nucleation experiments, and with the behavior predicted by classical binary nucleation theory. These experimental results will be useful to explain the contribution of ion-induced nucleation in different locations and atmospheric conditions.},

The product failures is modeled using a one-dimensional approach in which usage is a function of age. Furthermore, it is assumed that the relation between these variables is linear. The slope of the line is the usage rate. The optimal periodic maintenance time can be derived by minimizing the expected cost per unit time. We also proved that the expected cost per unit time is a concave function, and gave the global optimal solution. As a numerical example, we choose Weibull distribution with different levels of usage rates.

In specific, we consider the partition dimension of the corona graphs K1⊙{mKn}, Pm⊙K1,n and K1,m⊙Kn where Pm,K1,n and Kn are a path order m, a star order n+1 and a complete graph order n, respectively.},

	abstract = {Dengue disease has been known as one of dangerous vector-borne diseases and become serious threat in many tropical countries. With no vaccine and antiviral available until nowadays, and frequent appearance of extraordinary dengue outbreaks, many governments are forced to declare national problem for dengue. At this moment, the only method available to prevent dengue disease transmission is to combat the disease-carrying mosquitoes as well as to reduce the contact between human and mosquitoes. The fast growing dengue transmission in many countries in recent years indicates that the mosquito control programs are far from successful. The use of mosquito repellent is one possible instrument which could be used as an effective mass treatment to prevent the dengue outbreak during endemic period. Here in this paper a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (S-I-R) dengue transmission model with repellent mass treatment is being applied to portions of children and adult compartments. Analysis of the basic reproductive ratio (Ro) of the model is done. It is shown, with reasonable choices of portions of treated children and adults, in combination with reduction of mosquito population, the basic reproductive ratio can be significantly reduced and occurrence of endemic can be avoided. Numerical simulations are shown for various treatment scenarios.},

A model is matched on historical data until it reproduced the production history. The model can be used to simulate future reservoir production. The Ensemble Kalman Filter ({EnKF}) is a method designed for non linear history matching. The success of {EnKF} affected by non linearity of reservoir model. If the reservoir model is highly non linear the {EnKF} might be unstable. This paper aims to explore the stability of {EnKF} under different type reservoir models. Three type reservoir models are considered: (1) line source (2) bounded constant rate no flow (3) three grid reservoir. The permeability is estimated based on the matching of observed pressure with predicted pressure (obtained from reservoir model). A simulation experiment is set up to show how {EnKF} iteration may be used to estimate the permeability. The simulation is set up for an experiment time T, time step Δt, and number of observations m. The prior for permeability is drawn from normal distribution. The stability of the results is presented as plots of pressure history match and permeability updating. The three grid reservoir model shows instability of {EnKF} method, and an iterative {EnKF} was proposed to improve the stability of {EnKF}. The proposed method is able to history match the reservoir models, and exploring the stability of a more general reservoir model is needed for the success of the method.},

There are three main jobs in this paper, i.e. parameters estimation procedure, simulation, and implementation of the model for the real data. At the part of parameters estimation procedure, concepts of threshold, nested random effect, and computational algorithm are described. The simulations data are built for 3 conditions to know the effect of different parameter values of random effect distributions. The last job is the implementation of the model for the data about poverty in 9 districts of Java Island. The districts are Kuningan, Karawang, and Majalengka chose randomly in West Java; Temanggung, Boyolali, and Cilacap from Central Java; and Blitar, Ngawi, and Jember from East Java. The covariates in this model are province, number of bad nutrition cases, number of farmer families, and number of health personnel. In this modeling, all covariates are grouped as ordinal scale. Unit observation in this research is sub-district (kecamatan) nested in district, and districts (kabupaten) are nested in province. For the result of simulation, {ARB} (Absolute Relative Bias) and {RRMSE} (Relative Root of mean square errors) scale is used. They show that prov parameters have the highest bias, but more stable {RRMSE} in all conditions. The simulation design needs to be improved by adding other condition, such as higher correlation between covariates. Furthermore, as the result of the model implementation for the data, only number of farmer family and number of medical personnel have significant contributions to the level of poverty in Central Java and East Java province, and only district 2 (Karawang) of province 1 (West Java) has different random effect from the others. The source of the data is {PODES} (Potensi Desa) 2008 from {BPS} (Badan Pusat Statistik).},

The heat from nuclear fission reactions in nuclear reactors will be distributed through the process of conduction in fuel elements. Furthermore, the heat is delivered through a process of heat convection in the fluid flow in cooling channel. Temperature changes that occur in the coolant channels cause a decrease in pressure at the top of the reactor core. The governing equations in each channel consist of mass balance, momentum balance, energy balance, mass conservation and ideal gas equation. The problem is reduced to finding flow rates in each channel such that the pressure drops at the top of the reactor core are all equal. The problem is solved numerically with the genetic algorithm method. Flow rates and temperature distribution in each channel are obtained here.},

Our starting point is to embed an n-dimensional complete manifold into an (n+1)-dimensional manifold which admits a timelike Killing vector. Then, the scalar curvature depends on the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the n-dimensional submanifold. This operator is set to be equals to the linear combination of the Dirac-delta function on the submanifold which can be thought of as remove points on (n+1)-dimensional manifold. Using completeness of the n-dimensional submanifold it can be shown that the solution does indeed exist. As an example we give the explicit form for flat Euclidean geometries, sphere, and hyperbolic geometries.},

	abstract = {Tsunami is a series of wave trains which travels with high speed on the sea surface. This traveling wave is caused by the displacement of a large volume of water after the occurrence of an underwater earthquake or volcano eruptions. The speed of tsunami decreases when it reaches the sea shore along with the increase of its amplitudes. Two large tsunamis had occurred in the last decades in Indonesia with huge casualties and large damages. Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System has been installed along the west coast of Sumatra. This early warning system will give about 10-15 minutes to evacuate people from high risk regions to the safe areas. Here in this paper, a mathematical model for Tsunami evacuation is presented with the city of Padang as a study case. In the model, the safe areas are chosen from the existing and selected high rise buildings, low risk region with relatively high altitude and (proposed to be built) a flyover ring road. Each gathering points are located in the radius of approximately 1 km from the ring road. The model is formulated as an optimization problem with the total normalized evacuation time as the objective function. The constraints consist of maximum allowable evacuation time in each route, maximum capacity of each safe area, and the number of people to be evacuated. The optimization problem is solved numerically using linear programming method with Matlab. Numerical results are shown for various evacuation scenarios for the city of Padang.},

When thermal adaptation of Klentaq1 was analyzed at the atomic level, the protein was stable at 300 and 350 K. It gradually unfolded at 373 K and almost spontaneously unfolded at 400 K. Domain separation was induced by disrupting electrostatic interactions in two salt bridges formed by Lys354-Glu445 and Asp371-Arg435 on the interface domain. The role of these interactions in protein stability was evaluated by comparing free energy solvation (ΔΔGsolv) between wild type and mutants. Substitution of Asp371 by Glu or Asn, and also Glu445 by Asn resulted in a positive value of ΔΔGsolv, suggesting that mutations destabilized the protein structure. Nevertheless, substitution of Glu445 by Asp gave a negative value to ΔΔGsolv reflecting increasing protein stability. Our results demonstrate that interactions at the interface domains of Klentaq1 are essential factors correlated with the Klentaq1 thermostability.},

However, investigation of suitable solid support in enzyme immobilization is still a scientific challenge. Polyethersulfone ({PES}) and aminated {PES} ({PES}–{NH}2) were successfully synthesized as novel materials for immobilization. Membranes with various pore sizes (from 10–600 nm) based on synthesized {PES} and {PES}–{NH}2 polymers were successfully fabricated to be applied as bioreactors to increase the immobilized lipase performances. The influence of pore sizes, concentration of additives, and the functional groups that are attached on the {PES} backbone on enzyme loading and enzyme activity was studied. The largest enzyme loading was obtained by Mucor miehei lipase immobilized onto a {PES}–{NH}2 membrane composed of 10\% of {PES}–{NH}2, 8\% of dibutyl phthalate ({DBP}), and 5\% of polyethylene glycol ({PEG}) (872.62 µg/cm2). Hydrolytic activity of the immobilized lipases indicated that the activities of biocatalysts are not significantly decreased by immobilization. From the reusability test, the lipase immobilized onto {PES}–{NH}2 showed a better constancy than the lipase immobilized onto {PES} (the percent recovery of the activity of the lipases immobilized onto {PES}–{NH}2 and {PES} are 97.16\% and 95.37\%, respectively), which indicates that this novel material has the potential to be developed as a bioreactor for enzymatic reactions.},

	abstract = {Apatite-type lanthanum silicates show a great potential to be used as an electrolyte for intermediate- to low-temperature (600-700 C) solid oxide fuel cells ({ITSOFC}). However, so far these materials need to be prepared using a very high-temperature method, thus there is a growing interest to prepare apatites at lower temperatures. This paper reports the synthesis of undoped La9.33Si6O26 and doped apatites (La9CaSi6O26,5, La9SrSi6O26,5, and La9BaSi6O26,5) from raw materials La2O3, Na2SiO4, {BaCO}3, {CaCO}3, and {SrCO}3 using a hydrothermal method. The polycrystalline apatites were obtained as a white powder, after the basic solution of the reagent mixture was heated at 240 C in an autoclave for 3 days. Le Bail refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction data showed that the compounds have a hexagonal cell (P 63/m space group). In this paper, the undoped La9.33Si6O26 and La-doped apatite ionic conductivities are also presented.},

The introduction of Zn2+ cations slightly changed the specific surface area and crystallinity of {HBEA}. {IR}, {XPS} and solid state {MAS} {NMR} results showed that Zn2+ cations interacted with ({AlO})+ extraframework aluminum to form Zn({OAl})2 and simultaneously induced the formation of bridging hydroxyl groups, Si({OH})Al. The pyridine adsorbed {IR} study revealed that the presence of Zn2+ cations fully eliminated weak and partially eliminated strong Brønsted acid sites. As a result, strong and relatively weak Lewis acid sites were formed in which the pyridine probe molecule desorbed at 623K and below. The presence of Zn2+ cations enhanced the catalytic activity of {HBEA} in n-pentane isomerization due to the presence of strong Lewis acid sites; the sites may facilitate the formation and maintenance of active protonic acid sites through a hydrogen spillover mechanism. At 598K, the yield of isopentane for Zn-{HBEA} was 25.7\% higher than that of {HBEA}. Within a reaction temperature range of 373–648K, the apparent activation energy for isomerization of n-pentane over {HBEA} and Zn-{HBEA} was 118.76 and 90.79kJ/mol, respectively.},

This molecule is a metal-complex that consists of a porphyrin ring with high symmetry that acts as ligands with magnesium as the central ion. Chlorophyll a has been studied for many years from different point of views for both experimental and theoretical interests. In this study, the restricted Hartree-Fock configuration interaction single ({RHF}/{CIS}), time-dependent density functional theory ({TDDFT}) and some semi-empirical methods ({CNDO}/s and {ZINDO}) calculations were carried out and compared to reconstruct the {UV}-Vis absorption spectra of chlorophyll a. In some extend, the calculation results based on a single molecule calculation were succeeded to reconstruct the absorption spectra but required to be scaling to match the experimental one. Different computational methods (ab initio and semi-empirical) exhibit the differences in the energy correction factor and the presence of transition states, however, still conserve the main spectral features. In general, the semi-empirical methods provide a better energy scaling factor, which means closer to the experimental one. However, they lack of fine features or vertical transitions with respect to the experimental spectra. The ab initio calculations result more complete features than the semi-empirical methods, especially the {TDDFT} with high level of basis sets that provides a good accuracy in transition energies. The contribution of ground states and excited states orbitals in the main vertical transitions is discussed based on orbital structure. This might gives a new perspective to explain the energy transfer phenomena in the absorption processes that related to the function of chlorophyll a as a light-harvesting antenna.},

The N-succinylchitosan was blended with chitosan in acetic acid at various substitution degree of N-succinylchitosan with weight ratio of N-succinylchitosan of 80\% w/w. The acid-base complex membranes were cast from the polymer solution and dried by evaporation. The properties of the membranes such as water uptake, ion exchange capacity, proton conductivity, and mechanical strength were analyzed. It was observed that the increase of substitution degree of N-succinylchitosan tends to increase the proton conductivity. The optimum performance of membrane unit is attained by the substitution degree of N-succinylchitosan of 0.72, which is reflected by its ion exchange capacity of 3.45 meq/g and proton conductivity of 7.35 × 10-2 S cm-1, respectively. Blending of N-succinylchitosan and chitosan also improved the mechanical strength of the membranes.

The presence of benzalkonium chloride as the cationic surfactant, which interacts with the sulfonic groups on membrane surface, has to disturb the transport of K+ ions and directly gives responses in its chronopotentiogram. The electrodialysis of the cationic surfactant solution showed an irreversible monotonous increase of the total system potential due to the fouling phenomena. However, a small amount of cationic surfactant in the membrane surface vicinity was observed to give a fluctuating chronopotentiogram at the high current density. This fluctuation is started by a steep increase and followed by the decrease of potential, which finally relaxed to reach a steady state. This potential fluctuation is proposed to be the response of a structural transformation of surfactant micelles on the membrane surface under perturbation of the externally applied electric field, which is discussed and examined qualitatively in this report.},

This perfluorosulfonated membrane material exhibits good chemical stability and proton conductivity, but it is very expensive and difficult to recycle. There is a high methanol crossover in {DMFCs} that causes a decrease in efficiency and performance of the fuel cell, so that a polymer electrolyte membrane with a low methanol crossover is needed as a substitute for the Nafion membrane. One of the materials that can be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane is the polyblends from sulfonated polystyrene-lignosulfonate ({SPS}-{LS}). Such polyblends were prepared by casting a polymer solution and characterized as polyelectrolyte membrane for {DMFCs}. The {SPS} was prepared by sulfonation of polystyrene with acetyl sulfate as the sulfonating agent. The membranes of the {SPS}-{LS} were characterized by analysis of functional groups, mechanical properties and methanol permeability. The maximum mechanical properties of the {SPS}-{LS} membrane were observed at an {LS} ratio of 7.5\%. However, the methanol permeability of the membrane increased with the increase of the {LS} ratio in the {SPS}-{LS} membranes. The properties of the membranes, especially their mechanical properties and methanol permeability, were close to that of Nafion® 117 membrane, so {SPS}-{LS} membranes have high potential for use as polymer electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cells.},

In previous research, it was assumed that the beach can absorb all of the transmitted wave energy, when an optimal dimension for a submerged parallel bar is obtained and the wave amplitude is reduced as more bars are installed. However, for a hard-wall beach there are waves reflected from the beach that change the long-term wave interaction. We adopt the linear shallow water equations in Riemann invariant form and use the method of characteristics, in a procedure applicable to various formations of submerged rectangular bars. The distance from the parallel bar (or bars) to the beach determines the phase differences between right running waves in the beach basin and whether they superpose destructively or constructively before hitting the beach, to define the safest and the most dangerous cases. Our numerical calculations for one bar, two bars and for periodic rectangular bars confirm the analytical formulae obtained.},

In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the steady state case and solve the equation analytically by means of asymptotic expansion for a particular limit of the oxygen consumption rate. Results show that there exists a critical ratio between supply and consumption of oxygen in the tissue region in order to fulfill the cell’s oxygen requirements. Above from this critical ratio, we also found a critical distance in the tissue region above which the oxygen concentration vanishes. We compared our asymptotic results with numerical simulations, which turned out to be quite in agreement.},

In this study, the process is assumed to be a one-dimensional pseudohomogeneous model and takes place with a certain reaction rate in which thewhole process ofthereactor is still workable. Thus, the reaction rate can proceed at a fixed temperature. Under these conditions, we can restrict ourselves to solving the equations for the conversion only. From the available data, it turns out that the ratio of the diffusion term to the reaction term is small. Hence, this ratio is considered as a small parameter in our model and this leads to a singular perturbation problem. Numerical difficulties will be found in the vicinity of a small parameter in front of a higher order term. Here, we present an analytical solutionby means of matched asymptotic expansions. The result shows that, up to and including the first order of approximation, the solution is in agreement with the exact and numerical solutions of the boundary value problem.},

The present model consists of mud cake thickness model, flow rate of mud filtrate into oil formation, mud filtrate concentration, and penetration depth of mud filtrate. The estimation for reduction of oil effective permeability and skin factor near wellbore are also presented. The model is simulated and verified using three vertical well data cited from the literature. The estimation results of oil effective permeability reduction and skin factor from the model are in agreement with the data.

Since migration plays important role in disease transmission, we include immigration and emigration factors into the model which are distributed in each compartment. Meanwhile, the vector population is divided into susceptible, exposed, and infectious compartments. In the case when there is no incoming infected immigrant, we obtain the basic reproduction ratio as a threshold parameter for existence and stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria. Meanwhile, in the case when there are some incoming infected immigrants, we obtain only endemic equilibrium.

	abstract = {Comparing the quality of basic reservoir rock properties is a common practice  to  locate  new  infill  or  development  wells  for  optimizing  oil  field development using reservoir simulation. The conventional technique employs a manual  trial-and-error  process  to  find  new  well  locations,  which  proves  to  be time-consuming, especially for large fields. Concerning this practical matter, an alternative in the form of a robust technique is introduced in order to reduce time and  effort  in  finding  new  well  locations  capable  of  producing  the  highest  oil recovery. The objective of this research was to apply a genetic algorithm ({GA}) for determining well locations using reservoir simulation, in order to avoid the conventional  manual  trial-and-error  method.  This  {GA}  involved  the  basic  rock properties,  i.e.  porosity,  permeability,  and  oil  saturation,  of  each  grid  block obtained from a reservoir simulation model, to which a newly generated fitness function was applied, formulated by translating common engineering  practice in reservoir  simulation  into  a  mathematical  equation  and  then  into  a  computer program. The maximum fitness value indicates the best grid location for a new well. In order to validate the proposed {GA} method and evaluate the performance of the program, two fields with different production profile characteristics were used, fields X and Y. The proposed method proved to be a robust and accurate method to find the best new well locations for oil field development. The key to the success of the proposed  {GA} method lies in the formulation of the objective functions.},

In distributed technology perspective, cloud computing most like client-server services like web-based or web-service but it used virtual resources to execute.

We conduct an experimental setup to measure the quality of service received by cloud computing customers. Experimental setup done by creating a {HTTP} service that runs in the cloud computing infrastructure. We interest to know about the impact of increasing the number of users on the average quality received by users. The qualities received by user measured within two parameters consist of average response times and the number of requests time out. Experimental results of this study show that increasing the number of users has increased the average response time. Similarly, the number of request time out increasing with increasing number of users. It means that the qualities of service received by user are decreasing also. We found that the impact of the number of users on the quality of service is no longer in linear trend. The results of this study can be used as a reference model for the network operator in performing services in which a certain number of users in order to obtain optimal quality services.},

The Laplace transform was used to obtain an analytical solution of the diffusivity equation. A state space representation was generated using the analytical solution.

Numerical solutions are obtained by implementing the Godunov method. Our simulation of the temperature distribution and interface position for the one-dimensional Stefan problem is validated against the exact solution, and the method is then applied to the two-dimensional Stefan problem with reference to cryosurgery, where extremely cold temperatures are applied to destroy cancer cells.

In general, the innermost temperature, Tin, increases with the increase of i for a fixed value of \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\$\$ and a*, due to the Doppler effect. However, for i \&gt; 50° and \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\&gt;{\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turn\}\$\$, Tin starts to decrease with the increase of \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\$\$. This is a result of self-obscuration – the radiation from the innermost hot part of the disc is blocked by the surrounding cooler part. The value of \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turn\}\$\$ and the corresponding luminosities depend on a* and i. Such obscuration effects cause an interesting behaviour on the disc luminosity (Ldisc)–Tin plane for high inclinations. In addition to the standard disc branch which appears below \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turn\}\$\$ and which obeys \$\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm disc\} {\textbackslash}propto T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm in\}{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$\$ relation, another branch above \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turn\}\$\$, which is nearly horizontal, may be observed at luminosities close to the Eddington luminosity.

The resulting membranes are characterized by ion exchange capacity, contact angle, proton conductivity, swelling index, methanol permeability, mechanical properties measurement and morphological analysis. At the optimum phosphorylation condition using 17.35 mmol of phosphoric acid, membrane showed a proton conductivity of 1.2 × 10−2 S/cm and a methanol permeability of 2.3 × 10−6 cm2/s.

	abstract = {Nanoporous materials such as Mobil composite material number 41 ({MCM}-41) are attractive for applications such as catalysis, adsorption, supports, and carriers. Green synthesis of {MCM}-41 is particularly appealing because the chemical reagents are useful and valuable. We report on the eco-friendly synthesis of {MCM}-41 nanoporous materials via multi-cycle approach by re-using the non-reacted reagents in supernatant as mother liquor after separating the solid product. This approach was achieved via minimal requirement of chemical compensation where additional fresh reactants were added into the mother liquor followed by {pH} adjustment after each cycle of synthesis. The solid product of each successive batch was collected and characterized while the non-reacted reagents in supernatant can be recovered and re-used to produce subsequent cycle of {MCM}-41. The multi-cycle synthesis is demonstrated up to three times in this research. This approach suggests a low cost and eco-friendly synthesis of nanoporous material since less waste is discarded after the product has been collected, and in addition, product yield can be maintained at the high level.},

Mesoporous silica nanoparticles ({MSN}) was synthesized and modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane ({APTES}) using co-condensation ({MSNco}) and post-grafting ({MSNpost}) methods. X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) and transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) data confirmed the formation of ordered mesostructured silica nanoparticles. The performance of {MSNs} was then tested on an ibuprofen immobilization and release. The results revealed that unmodified {MSN} demonstrated the best immobilization rate and capacity of ibuprofen (98\%), {MSNpost} exhibited higher ibuprofen adsorption (78\%) as compared to {MSNco} (71\%), suggesting the modification method is not the dominant factor for the adsorption studied. In fact, according to the {FT}-{IR} results, the silanol groups density was found to be the contributing factor that affected the adsorption. The in vitro drug release was also investigated with simulated biological fluids. In 20h, {MSNco} showed the fastest release of ibuprofen (100\%), followed by {MSN} (50\%) and {MSNpost} (38\%). Both pore size and amine groups influenced the rate of the release process. From the results, {MSN} and {MSNpost} is suggested to have suitable features for slow drug release which provides constant release over a defined period to avoid repeated administration. While {MSNco} could be best employed as a fast release system that provides initial burst of drug release to achieve rapid and maximum relief.},

	abstract = {Several methods were used to investigate the possibility of preparing inclusion complexes between amylose and polytetrahydrofurans ({PTHF}) via direct mixing. Potato amylose (Mv ∼ 200 kg/mol) and synthetic amylose (Mn 42 kg/mol) were complexed with {PTHF} having different molecular weights (Mn between 650 and 2900 g/mol) to study the effect of the length of the host and the guest molecules on the complexation. The resulted products were studied by differential scanning calorimetry ({DSC}) that showed a characteristic melting peak in the range of 120–140 °C. Emulsification of both amylose and polytetrahydrofuran improved the complexation. The largest amount of complexes was obtained with shorter {PTHF} chains, which also resulted in less amylose retrogradation. Furthermore, {PTHF} chains with similar molecular weight but different end groups were used. Amine terminated {PTHF} formed a higher amount of complexes compared to the hydroxyl terminated {PTHF}. However, no amylose complexes were formed using benzoyl terminated {PTHF} with low molecular weight. This is due to the bulky group of benzoyl, which indicates that the mechanism of the complexation between amylose and {PTHF} occurs via insertion rather than wrapping. In addition, X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) analysis showed that the included {PTHFs} induced the formation of the so-called V-amylose with six glucose residues per helix turn. Some additional diffraction peaks indicate that the induced V6-amylose is probably an intermediate or the mixtures between V6I- and V6II-amylose.},

The influences of Al concentration on the surface morphology and electrical properties of {AZO} layer were investigated by atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements. The experimental results indicate that Al concentration has major influence on the grain size and only minor influence on crystallite size, leading to different surface morphology for different doping concentrations. Doping at high concentration produces higher charge carrier density, but not for charge carrier mobility and its electrical conductivity, which may be also influenced by the surface morphology. The effects of Al concentration in {AZO} layer were also observed in the J–V (current density–voltage) and small {AC} impedance characteristics of the fabricated solar cells. The resistance increases with Al concentration, but the capacitance decreases. The solar cell using {AZO} layer with doping concentration of 0.5wt\% shows the smallest impedance and the best J–V characteristics with the highest conversion efficiency. These characteristics seem to be correlated with the properties of {AZO} layer and its interface with the active layer.},

One strategy is to produce porous materials so that the entire area of the {WO}3 material can be used and activated effectively. In this study, we synthesized macroporous {WO}3 particles using a spray-pyrolysis method with colloidal templating. Ammonium tungsten pentahydrate ({ATP}) was used to produce {WO}3 without impurities, and polystyrene ({PS}) spheres were used to promote spherical macropore formation. The synthesized particles were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}). Several process parameters (i.e. initial precursor concentration and mass ratio between host and template) were investigated to get highly ordered porous particles with controllable porous structure and particle outer diameter. Photocatalytic analysis results showed that the amount of {PS} that provided the optimum photocatalytic enhancement. Our results showed that a {PS}/{ATP} mass ratio of 0.60 provided {WO}3 particles with a photocatalytic rate 2.5 times that of dense {WO}3. {TEM} analysis showed that highly ordered macropores were produced, enabling better penetration and interaction of molecules and light in the deepest part of the active catalyst, resulting in enhancement of the photocatalytic rate.

One strategy is to produce nanocomposite phosphors in which a cheaper and more readily available material is used as a matrix for an {RE} oxide. In this study, we produced a {YAG}:Ce/{SiO}2 nanocomposite using a sol–gel method; poly(ethylene glycol) and urea were added to promote micelle formation and agglomeration, respectively.

Our results showed that an {SiO}2 concentration of 10 vol\% provided a {PL} intensity 120\% that of pure {YAG}:Ce. {TEM} analysis showed that {SiO}2 nanoparticles covered the voids between the single grain boundaries of the {YAG}:Ce crystals, thereby inhibiting light scattering, resulting in enhanced {PL}.

Understanding the self-assembly phenomenon allows the creation of creative materials with unique structures that may offer performance improvements in a variety of applications. However, current research on the self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles have been conducted only on uncharged droplet systems. In this report, we first investigated the self-assembly processes of charged colloidal nanoparticles in charged droplets during spray-drying. Silica nanoparticles and polystyrene spheres are used as a model system. To induce a positive or a negative charge on the droplets, we used an electrospray method. Repulsive and attractive interactions between charged colloidal nanoparticles and droplet surface are found to control the self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles inside the charged droplet. Interestingly, self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles inside charged droplets under various processing parameters (i.e., droplet charge, droplet diameter, and surface charge, size, and composition of colloidal nanoparticles) allows the formation of unique nanostructured particles, including porous and hollow particles with control over the internal structure, external shape, number of hollow cavities, and shell thickness, in which this level of control cannot be achieved using conventional spray-drying method.},

In the asymptotic region, the complex scalars are fixed and regular which can be viewed as the critical points of the black hole and the scalar potentials with vanishing scalar charges. It follows that the asymptotic geometries are of a constant and nonzero scalar curvature which are generally not Einstein. These spaces could also correspond to the near horizon geometries which are the product spaces of a two anti-de Sitter surface and the two sphere if the value of the scalars in both regions coincide. In addition, we prove the local existence of nontrivial radius dependent complex scalar fields which interpolate between the horizon and the asymptotic region. We finally give some simple ℂn-models with both linear superpotential and gauge couplings.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an analysis of a three-dimensional singularly perturbed conservative system. We add a constant vector in the vector field to remove one of the symmetries in the system. Using the geometric argument, and a theorem which is derived from the implicit function theorem, we prove the existence of equilibria in the system and also derive some local bifurcations of these equilibria, i.e. saddle-node bifurcations. We also show that although we have two saddle-nodes in the system, the codimension-2 bifurcation called the cusp bifurcation is not possible. More sophisticated bifurcations, such as the Hopf bifurcation and the bifurcation of the created periodic solution are derived by using the numerical continuation software {MATCONT}. Following the periodic solution, we found a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations which leads to the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions. The coexistence of two attractors is an interesting phenomenon which is observed in this paper. Using asymptotic analysis, we discuss the dynamics in the neighborhood of a particular line in phase space at which the competition between these attractors takes place.},

In order to improve the accuracy of the calculation, recent empirical correlations of pressure drop coefficient and inter-channel mixing for evaluation of coolant flow in wire-wrapped fuel subassemblies have been incorporated into the subchannel analysis model. To confirm the prediction capability of the model, calculations and comparisons with available experimental data of 19- and 37-pin subassemblies have been performed. A comparison with previous results of a 127-pin subassembly has also been performed. The results show that empirical correlations which consider three subchannel types separately are capable of predicting the coolant temperature distribution at bundle outlet best among models. Moreover it has been found that the agreement between calculation result and experimental data of outlet temperature distribution improves when bundle hot dimensions are employed. In addition to the conventional flow resistance models, performance of a method of directly varying coolant flow areas to model geometrical disturbance due to the presence of wire spacers has been evaluated. It has been found that the method is capable of simulating crossflows between adjacent subchannels. All the results show reasonably good agreement with the reference data, in which the root mean square ({RMS}) differences are within 10\% for all cases analyzed in this study.},

The accumulative fuel loading scheme has unique characteristics that make it different from Multipass or Once Through Then Out ({OTTO}) fuel loading schemes. In this fueling scheme, significant changes of power distributions occur in a limited area at the top of the reactor core, where new fuel pebbles are inserted during reactor operation. We analyzed three different reactor conditions: different heights of the active core at the beginning, middle, and end of life as a consequence of the accumulative fuel loading scheme. In the analysis of a depressurized loss-of-flow accident, it was assumed that no natural circulation was possible, so that heat would be transferred through conduction and radiation with the last heat sink being the ground. Our analysis obtained temperature distributions inside the reactor core for each condition. The maximum temperature achieved in our simulation was 1287°C, which is lower than the safety limit of 1600°C.},

This study includes core neutronic and thermal hydraulic aspects. The power uprate is achieved by minimizing core radial power peaking, and by increasing fuel enrichment and coolant mass flow rate. Parametric calculations have been carried out to optimize the power-uprated core design, with the objective of obtaining relatively low core power peaking and similar initial reactivity with that of the reference core. The optimization is achieved by means of enrichment zoning and application of burnable poison, with different configuration from that of the reference core. The performance of power-uprated core is compared with the reference core. The calculation results show that the proposed core-uprated design with thermal power of 1200MWt shows preferable characteristics, such as low power peaking of around 1.43, negative reactivity coefficients, and relatively high {MDNBR} of 3.454.},

The method was used to predict the limit values of the injected oxygen into the liquid lead for maximum corrosion inhibition of iron. It is from experimental results, in order to inhibit the corrosion at possible lowest rate then a stable self-healing protective iron oxide layer should be developed at the surface of steel continuously. In this research we investigated the iron corrosion and it can be predicted that the protective oxide layer may be formed by injecting oxygen within the range of 5.35×10−2wt\% to 8.95×10−2wt\% (for observed temperature 750°C). The oxygen 5.35×10−2wt\% is the lower limit to prevent high dissolution of iron while the oxygen content of 8.95×10−2wt\% is the upper limit to avoid high precipitation of lead oxide. We also guess that effect of oxygen injection into liquid lead creates a thin oxygen barrier that separating the liquid lead and iron oxides from direct interaction. The iron oxides layer and oxygen barrier then may be regarded as double corrosion inhibition.},

In view of importance of the accurate description of the velocity profile and eddy diffusivity, in the present work the computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) is utilized. Our interest however, lies not in radiotracer experiment, dispersion determination and {CFD} simulations as separate tasks, but in their relation. This work clearly shows what physical interpretation of experimental conditions mean in view of two definitions of tracer concentration and different possible initial/boundary conditions. Similarly to selection of the mathematical model adequate to experimental conditions, the main difficulty in numerical tracer test is in finding an approach that may be accepted as adequate to the real tracer test. In fact, the {CFD} simulations should resemble the real tracer investigation. From two different approaches examined, the unsteady option of {CFD} solver and species transport model was selected as appropriate. The considerations on experiment/simulation relation apply not only to radiotracer but other tracer techniques as well.},

Recently, a concept which called as thorium molten salt nuclear energy synergetic ({THORIMS}-{NES}) was being proposed for the safe and sustainable nuclear industry. {THORIMS}-{NES} {miniFUJI} reactor is a small power {MSR} which originally considers Th/233U or Th/Pu as main fuel. In this study, the utilization of Pu and minor actinides ({MA}) in 25MWth and 50MWth {miniFUJI} reactors has been evaluated. The reactor grade plutonium and weapon grade plutonium are employed in the present study. The criticality for 25MWth of {miniFUJI} can be accomplished by loading 8.76\% of reactor grade Pu \& {MA} ({RGPuMA}), and 3.96\% of weapon grade Pu \& {MA} ({WGPuMA}) in fuel, respectively. While, for that of 50MWth, the reactor can attain its criticality with 9.16\% and 4.36\% of {RGPuMA} and {WGPuMA}, correspondingly. The neutron spectra become harder with the lower grade of fissile plutonium vector as well as the increasing of Pu and {MA} contents in loaded fuel salt.},

	abstract = {Recycling minor actinide ({MA}) as well as used uranium and plutonium can be considered to reduce nuclear waste production as well as to increase the intrinsic aspect of nuclear nonproliferation as doping material. Plutonium production as a significant aspect of recycling nuclear fuel option, gives some advantages and challenges, such as fissile material utilization of plutonium as well as production of some even mass number plutonium. The study intends to evaluate the material attractiveness based on the intrinsic feature of material barrier such as plutonium composition, decay heat and spontaneous fission neutron components from spent fuel ({SF}) light water reactor ({LWR}) and fast breeder reactor ({FBR}) cycles. A significant contribution has been shown by decay heat ({DH}) and spontaneous fission neutron ({SFN}) of even mass number of plutonium isotopes to the total {DH} and {SFN} of plutonium element, in particular from isotopic plutonium Pu-238 and Pu-240 contributions. Longer decay cooling time and higher burnup are effective to increase the material barrier ({DH} and {SFN}) level from reactor grade plutonium level to {MOX} grade plutonium level. Material barrier of plutonium element from spent fuel ({SF}) {FBR} in the core regions has similarity to the material barrier profile of {SF} {LWR} which can be categorized as {MOX} fuel grade plutonium. Plutonium compositions, {DH} and {SFN} components are categorized as weapon grade plutonium level for {FBR} blanket regions with no doping minor actinide ({MA}) case. Doping {MA} in the {FBR} blanket regions is effective to increase the material barrier level from weapon grade plutonium to {MOX} fuel or more grade level. Moreover, increasing material barrier of plutonium isotopes can be achieved effectively by increasing Pu-238 production as main contributor for {LWR} and {FBR} core regions, and from converted {MA} in the {FBR} blanket which affects directly to increase {DH} and {SFN} components.},

	abstract = {We consider a product sold with two-dimensional warranties - such cars, trucks, etc. In the last decade, the manufacturer offers a greater age and mileage coverage in the warranty term - e.g. a car is warranted for maximum of 5 years or 10×103 miles. The greater warranty coverage results in a higher product competitiveness, but that will increase the warranty cost to the manufacturer for servicing the warranty. This will become a major interest to the manufacturer to reduce the warranty cost. An appropriate servicing strategy involving replacement or imperfect repair reduces the warranty cost significantly. A variety of such servicing strategies has been studied in the literature, but most of them deal with one dimensional warranties and the number of replacement or imperfect repair allowed at most one. For a product sold with a greater age and mileage warranty coverage, two or more imperfect repairs will be needed in order to reduce the warranty cost. In this paper, we study servicing strategies which allows more then one imperfect repairs for the case of two dimensional warranties. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the optimal solution (in term of the optimal parameter values of the servicing strategies studied and the corresponding expected warranty costs) and then compare the results with those of the servicing strategy with only one imperfect repair.},

This associated coronal holes have filament-like morphology with a thick long thread as it’s ‘spine’, defined as Deep Coronal Hole. Because of strong magnetic field of sunspot, these filaments and coronal holes emerged far from active region and lasted for several days. It is interesting as for segmented filament, deep coronal holes above the filaments lasted for a quite long period of time and merged. This association between filament and deep coronal hole can be explained by filament magnetic loop.},

The comet resides in near-Earth space and no cometary outgassing component constants are available. Using recent orbital data on May 2012, we numerically followed a nominal orbit of the comet and put all planets as perturbing bodies. We find that C/1999 X3 will plunge into the sun in only about 2100 yrs. This lifetime is roughly a quarter that of the known sun-grazer comet 96P/Machholz 1. Involving an adopted 96P model of cometary outgassing and relativity correction into the equations of motion of the comet will insignificantly shorten its lifetime, before impact. We generated about 3500 orbital clones of C/1999 X3 to analyze orbital variations of the comet. Results show that 95\% clones will impact the Sun over the lifetime. This high solar impact probability offers a study of cometary dynamics in near-Earth space for which it may indicate a new group of Sun-grazer.},

We aimed to study the behavior of long term interval of state A in {GRS} 1915+105. Similar to the previous studies, we used color-color diagram for our analysis after correcting for the background. We also considered the absorption effect of the interstellar medium which is dominant below 10 {keV}. In general, the obtained results are in good agreement with the previous studies.

The stability of such triple star systems has been of interest to many authors.

In this study, they considered stars of mass 0.01 – 100 solar mass, with mass ratio range of 1 – 100. By using Mercury code, we extend their work to study the effects of initial inclination to the stability of the systems. The code validation results in an agreement with their results, i.e the bigger the period ratio of a system from its critical period ratio, the system will tend to be more stable. In this paper, we report the results of our simulations which have been performed to see how initial inclination affects the stability of a system. A grid of three initial parameters (distance, inclination, and phase) has been used to initiate the simulations.

	abstract = {Gravitational lens time delay method has been used to estimate the rate of cosmological expansion, called the Hubble constant, H0, independently of the standard candle method. This gravitational lensing method requires a good knowledge of the lens mass distribution, reconstructed using the lens image properties. The observed positions of the images, and the redshifts of the lens and the images serve as strong constraints to the lens equations, which are then solved as a set of simultaneous linear equations. Here we made use of a non-parametric technique to reconstruct the lens mass distribution, which is manifested in a linear equations solver named {PixeLens}. Input for the calculation is chosen based on prior known parameters obtained from analyzed result of the lens case observations, including time-delay, position angles of the images and the lens, and their redshifts. In this project, 18 fairly well studied lens cases are further grouped according to a number of common properties to examine how each property affects the character of the data, and therefore affects the calculation of H0. The considered lens case properties are lens morphology, number of image, completeness of time delays, and symmetry of lens mass distribution. Analysis of simulation shows that paucity of constraints on mass distribution of a lens yields wide range value of H0, which reflects the uniqueness of each lens system. Nonetheless, gravitational lens method still yields H0 within an acceptable range of value when compared to those determined by many other methods. Grouping the cases in the above manner allowed us to assess the robustness of {PixeLens} and thereby use it selectively. In addition, we use glafic, a parametric mass reconstruction solver, to refine the mass distribution of one lens case, as a comparison.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, reconstruction of porous rock as well as its modelling has been developed vastly, which has been possible because of the μ{CT} scanning devices. One of a famous rock that has been a subject of many researches in the characterization of porous medium is the Fontainebleau sandstone. Its homogeneity of the pore structure has been one of the reasons of the development of computational analyses that have also been applied to characterize the rock. The characteristics include porosity, permeability, curvature, pore connectivity, and percolation. Many models have also been developed based on the properties of this rock, e.g., the Gaussian Field model, Diagenesis model, Simulated Annealing model and Continuum Geometrical model. In this paper we are interested in the characteristic of the pore geometry of Fontainebleau and its models, i.e., the quantification of pore shape. We performed analysis based on Fourier Descriptor, which utilized Complex Fourier analysis where the boundary of the 2D pore is circumnavigated in the complex plane, such as to obtain the shape boundary coordinates of an object. The analysis using Fourier Descriptors demonstrates that the complexity level can be distinguished using the extracted length characteristic of the shape signature, i.e., the higher the level of complexity, the higher the length characteristic of shape signature. From this analysis we conclude that the Continuum Geometrical model has the most similar pore geometry characteristics with the Fontainebleau sandstone.},

Characterization was then also possible to conduct using computational approach. Hydrocarbon bearing sandstone has become one of interesting objects to analyze in the last decade. In this research, we performed digital characterization of hydrocarbon bearing sandstone reservoir from Sumatra. The sample was digitized using a μ{CT} scanner (Skyscan 1173) which produced series of reconstructed images with the spatial resolution of 15 μm. Using computational approaches, i.e., image processing, image analysis, and simulation of fluid flow inside the rock using Lattice Boltzmann Method, we have been able to obtain the porosity of the sandstone, which is 23.89\%, and the permeability, which is 9382 {mD}. Based on visual inspection, the porosity value, along with the calculated specific surface area, we produce a preliminary computer model of the rock using grain based method. This method employs a reconstruction of grains using the non-spherical model, and a purely random deposition of the grains in a virtual three dimensional cube with the size of 300 × 300 × 300. The model has porosity of 23.96\%, and the permeability is 7215 {mD}. While the error of the porosity is very small (which is only 0.3\%), the permeability has error of around 23\% from the real sample which is considered very significant. This suggests that the modeling based on porosity and specific surface area is not satisfactory to produce a representative model. However, this work has been a good example of how characterization and modeling of porous rock can be conducted using a non-destructive computational approach.},

In most cases, characterizations of cracks are often difficult to be performed. However, through the vast development of imaging technique, many researches have been conducted in order to obtain better understanding regarding the nature of cracks. Using micro-{CT} (μ{CT}) scanning devices, i.e., the Skyscan 1173, we were able to obtain 3D images of geothermal reservoir rock from West Java. The rock sample was scanned using X-ray voltage of 130 {kV} and current of 61 μA. The reconstructed images have spatial resolution of 59.85 μm/pixel. Using {CTVox} and {ImageViewer}, we were able to visualize the cracks both in 2D and 3D perspective. We further performed image processing and analysis, i.e.: simple segmentation of pore-solid by thresholding the gray values and binarizing the images, de-noising (despeckling), and 3D structure analysis. From these analyses, we obtain the value of porosity of 6.27\%, and from further analysis, we separate the crack from the granular pore. The fraction of the cracks is 2.35\% from the total volume of the sample. This preliminary study however, still contains some errors. By visualizing the produced image from the isolation, we can still observed the existence of isolated granular pores. Nonetheless, this study has confirmed that using image processing and image analysis approach of reconstructed μ{CT} images, we were able to isolate cracks from granular pores, and also calculate the volume fraction of the cracks.},

The {UV}-Vis spectrum of 7H4MC in methanol showed λmax at 235 and 337 nm. The observed fluorescence is the fluorescence color of cyan. The excitation wavelengths are 200, 235, 275, 337, and 365 nm. The highest intensity of cyan color fluorescence of chitosan containing 7H4MC films was obtained at the concentration of 0.2\% of 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin at the excitation wavelength of 275 nm.},

	abstract = {Solid oxides fuel cells ({SOFCs}) is one technology that could contribute toward future sustainable energy. One of the most important components of an {SOFC} is the electrolyte, which must have high ionic conductivity. Cation substitution of vanadium in Bi4V2O11 yields a family of fast oxide ion conducting solids known collectively as the {BIMEVOXes} (bismuth metal vanadium oxide), which have the potential to be applied as electrolytes in {SOFCs}. The purpose of this work is to study the effect of Ni concentration, when used as a dopant, on the ionic conductivity of Bi2NixV1−{xO}5.5−3x/2 ({BINIVOX}) oxides (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) when prepared by a sol gel method. The gels were calcined at 600 °C for 24 h to produce pure {BINIVOX}. These oxides were found to exhibit the γ-phase structure with tetragonal symmetry in space group I4/mmm. Ionic conductivity of {BINIVOX} at 300 °C were 6.9 × 10−3 S cm−1, 1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1, and 8.2 × 10−4 S cm−1, for x = 0.1; 0.15; and 0.2; respectively; and at 600 °C were 1.1 × 10−1 S cm−1, 5.3 × 10−2 S cm−1, and 2.8 ×10−2 S cm−1, for x = 0.1; 0.15; and 0.2; respectively.},

Moreover, {SEM} and {AFM} images show the uniform thin film carbon on Si with {HF} treatment, in contrast to the Si without {HF} solution treatment. These experimental results suggest that {HF} treatment of Si surface provide Si-H bonds on top Si surface that useful to enhance the carbon deposition during sputtering process. Furthermore, we investigate the thermal stability of thin film carbon on Si by thermal annealing process up to 900 °C. Atomic arrangements during annealing process were characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra indicate that thin film carbon on Si is remaining unchanged until 600 °C and carbon atoms start to diffuse toward Si substrate after annealing at 900 °C.},

Furthermore, from the diffraction pattern is obtained, the calculation to determine the crystallite size of the sample by using the Scherrer equation. From the experimental results and the calculation of crystallite sizes obtained for the samples with temperature 130 °C up to 170 °C respectively increased from 7.2 nm up to 20.54 nm. These results show that increasing temperatures will also increase the size of the crystallite of the sample. This happens because with the increasing temperature causes the higher the degree of crystallization of {PVDF} film sample is formed, so that the crystallite size also increases.

This can be happened due to spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry. Moreover, the edge current flows through their edge or surface depends on its spin orientation and also it is robust against non-magnetic impurities. Therefore, topological insulators are predicted to be useful ranging from spintronics to quantum computation. Graphene was first predicted to be the precursor of topological insulator by Kane-Mele. They developed a Hamiltonian model to describe the gap opening in graphene. In this work, we investigate the band structure of few-layer graphene by using this model with analytical approach. The results of our calculations show that the gap opening occurs at K and K’ point, not only in single layer, but also in bilayer and trilayer graphene.},

In order to be applied as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells ({PEMFCs}), membrane polymer should have a good ionic conductivity, high proton conductivity, and high mechanical strength. Lignosulfonate ({LS}) is a complex biopolymer which has crosslinks and sulfonate groups. {SPS}-{LS} blends with addition of {SiO}2 are used to increase the proton conductivity and to improve the mechanical properties and thermal stability. However, the biodegradation test of {SPS}-{LS} blends is required to determine whether the application of these membranes to be applied as an environmentally friendly membrane.

The biodegradation test was carried out in solid medium of Luria Bertani ({LB}) with an activated sludge used as a source of microorganism at incubation temperature of 37°C. Based on the results obtained indicated that {SPS}-{LS}-{SiO}2 blends are more decomposed by microorganism than {SPS}-{LS} blends.

	abstract = {The Iron({II}) complex with 4-amino-1,2,4 triazole ({NH}2-trz) ligand has potential applications as smart material since the compounds show a distinct color change from lilac at low temperature to colorless at high temperature. The lilac color of the complex represent the diamagnetic low spin state while the colorless correspond to the paramagnetic high spin state of iron({II}). The transition between the two states could be tuned by changing the anionic group. Generally, the complex was synthesized directly from aqueous solution of iron({II}) salt with considerable amounts of {NH}2-trz solution produced solid powder compound. For application as an electronic molecular device, the complex should be obtained as a thin film. The transparent [Fe({NH}2trz)3]-Nafion film has been successfully obtained, however, no anion variation can be produced since the nafion is an anionic resin. In this work, the [Fe({NH}2trz)3]-complexes with several anions have been synthesized inside nata de coco membrane that commonly used as a medium for deposition metal nano-particles. After drying the membrane containing the complex became a thin film. At room temperature, the film containing iron({II}) complexes of sulphate and nitrate salts show lilac color, similar to that of the original complexes in the powder form. On heating, the color of the complex film changed to colorless and this color change was observed reversibly. In contrast, the films containing perchlorate and tetrafluoroborate iron({II}) complexes are colorless at room temperature and changed to lilac on cooling. The significant color changing of the iron({II})complexes in the nata de coco film can be used for demonstration thermo chromic effect of smart materials with relatively small amount of the compounds.},

This protein is the initial part of the two-component system {PhoR}-{PhoP} regulating 114 genes related to the virulence of Mtb. In this study, the gene encoding {PhoR} sensor domain ({SensPhoR}) was subcloned from {pGEM}-T {SensPhoR} from the previous study (Suwanto, 2012) to {pColdII}. The construct {pColdII} {SensPhoR} was confirmed through restriction analysis and sequencing. Using the construct, {SensPhoR} was overexpressed at 15°C using Escherichia coli {BL}21 ({DE}3). Low temperature was chosen because according to the solubility prediction program of recombinant proteins from The University of Oklahama, the {PhoR} sensor domain has a chance of 79.8\% to be expressed as insoluble proteins in Escherichia coli's (E. coli) cytoplasm. This prediction is also supported by other similar programs: {PROSO} and {PROSO} {II}. The {SDS} {PAGE} result indicated that the {PhoR} sensor domain recombinant protein was overexpressed.

In addition, the activity assay of extracts of different tissues of this species showed antitumor, antimalarial, and antidiabetic activityies (leaves and seed extracts), antioxidants (flower extract), and analgesic (wood extract). Though the extracts of S. sesban parts showed interesting activities, chemical study of those extracts have not been widely reported. Therefore, the objective of this research was to isolate the secondary metabolites from methanol extract of leaves of S. sesban and to determine their cytotoxicity against murine leukemia P-388 cells.

	abstract = {Micro Computed Tomography (μ{CT}) has been largely used to perform micrometer scale imaging of specimens, bone biopsies and small animals for the study of porous or cavity-containing objects. One of its favored applications is for assessing structural properties of bone. In this research, we perform a pilot study to visualize and characterize bone structure of a chicken bone thigh, as well as to delineate its cortical and trabecular bone regions. We utilize an In-Vitro μ{CT} scanner Skyscan 1173 to acquire a three dimensional image data of a chicken bone thigh. The thigh was scanned using X-ray voltage of 45 {kV} and current of 150 μA. The reconstructed images have spatial resolution of 142.50 μm/pixel. Using image processing and analysis e.i segmentation by thresholding the gray values (which represent the pseudo density) and binarizing the images, we were able to visualize each part of the bone, i.e., the cortical and trabecular regions. Total volume of the bone is 4663.63 mm3, and the surface area of the bone is 7913.42 mm2. The volume of the cortical is approximately 1988.62 mm3 which is nearly 42.64\% of the total bone volume. This pilot study has confirmed that the μ{CT} is capable of quantifying 3D bone structural properties and defining its regions separately. For further development, these results can be improved for understanding the pathophysiology of bone abnormality, testing the efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention, or estimating bone biomechanical properties.},

In this paper, we try to simulate the behavior of hydrocephalus conditions in infant head by using a hydro-elastic model which is combined with orthotropic elastic skull and with the addition of suture that divide the skull into two lobes. The model then gives predictions for the case of stenosis aqueduct by varying the cerebral aqueduct diameter, time constant and brain elastic modulus. The hydrocephalus condition which is shown by the significant value of ventricle displacement, as the result shows, is occurred when the aqueduct is as resistant as brain parenchyma for the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. The decrement of brain elastic modulus causes brain parenchyma displacement value approach ventricle displacement value. The smaller of time constant value causes the smaller value of ventricle displacement.},

	abstract = {Estimation of recoverable reservoir reserve should be as accurate as possible. Detailed reservoir parameter estimation is needed to ensure good estimate. Many uncertainties exist in recovery estimation due to reservoir rock properties such as permeability and porosity. The estimate of such parameters may change with the available observations and time. This paper reports the use of Bayesian ensemble Kalman filter ({EnKF}) to estimate the permeability. It is a method in which a sample of state are generated and updated sequentially. Two simulated experiments are presented to investigate the applicability of {EnKF}. The first concern is using {EnKF} for parameter estimation in reservoir models such as line source, bounded reservoir, 1D flow numerical model. The second concern is using {EnKF} in one dimensional two interacting wells. The solutions are derived analytically. The state consists of the parameters and the analytical solution. The estimation process consists of two steps: forecast and update. Forecast step is calculated by using forward function which can be analytical or numerical solution. Update step uses Kalman filter scheme where the gain is calculated from sample covariance. Asymptotic studies as the basis for the validity of {EnKF} is well established and summarized in this report. The study concludes that {EnKF} can provide satisfactory results for reservoir reserve parameter estimation. Parameter estimation for reservoir simulation is an important future issue in order to improve the forecast.},

The four hydrogen atoms in {CH}4 are permuted by the action of the symmetry group and this action fixes the carbon atom. At each of the 5 vertices, we assign three unit vectors, called the standard basis vectors in directions of the three edges which are joined to the vertex. The symmetry group G of the molecules permutes the 15 standard basis vectors, so we may regard ℚ15 as a 𝔾G By expressing ℚ15 as a direct sum of irreducible 𝔾G-modules, the problem of finding the normal modes of vibration is reduced to that of computing the eigenvectors of some small matrices.},

Plasma leakage is a consequence of the immune system mechanism which activates cytokine. As a result, permeability of vascular will increase. Another characteristic in a {DHF} patient is hypoalbuminea (decreasing of albumin concentration). Plasma leakage can be modelled by constructing mathematical model of albumin concentration in plasma blood due to increasing of cytokine. In this paper, decreasing of albumin concentration in blood plasma is modelled using diffusion equation. In addition, two-dimensional numerical simulations of albumin concentration are also presented. From the simulation, it is found that the greater leakage rate or the wider leakage area, the greater decreasing albumin concentration will be. Furthermore, when time t increases, the albumin concentration decreases to zero.},

In this paper, we analyze the effect of flight retiming to the robustness of flight schedule. We construct a simulation for measuring the robustness of the flight schedule, where the probability of crew pairing found after a number of flight delays happen is used as the measure of robustness. It is shown that the retiming will increase the robustness of the schedule if we only retime the flights which appear in the first cycle of the set of selected pairings.},

Several studies have concluded that Ascogregarina taiwanensis caused high fatality for Aedes aegypti larvae, but Ascogregarina culicis was not pathogenic to Aedes albopictus larvae. Therefore, Ascogregarina taiwanensis may contribute to reduce the number of populations Aedes aegypti in the fields. Inspired by these facts, a mathematical model depicting interaction between parasites and mosquitoes is constructed in this paper. In this model are included six dynamic mosquito compartments, i.e. egg, larvae, infected larvae, adult, infected adult and one dynamic compartment for parasite.

In his paper, transmission of diarrhea disease in evacuation zone using {SIRS} model is presented as control optimum problem with clean water supply and rate of treated patients as input controls. Existence and stability of equilibrium points and sensitivity analysis are investigated analytically for constant input controls.

Shoaling and refraction are both direct consequence of energy conservation. In this paper we solve the 2D shallow water equations using the conservative finite volume method. This scheme is non dissipative, therefore it can produce shoaling coefficient correctly. Simulation of 2D plane wave above a parallel bottom contours shows that numerical wave refraction confirms the analytical wave refraction. In this way we are convinced that our scheme can produce shoaling and refraction correctly. When a wave travels over a continental shelf and further to the beach, before breaking, the wave will experience shoaling and refraction which is not homogeneous along the beach. Numerical simulation shows that a bottom sill may induce wave focusing. This wave focusing governed by offshore topography may explain the striking differences from the adjacent coastal damage.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy Logic in decision-making process has been widely implemented in various problems in industries. It is the theory of imprecision and uncertainty that was not based on probability theory. Fuzzy Logic adds values of degree between absolute true and absolute false. It starts with and builds on a set of human language rules supplied by the user. The fuzzy systems convert these rules to their mathematical equivalents. This could simplify the job of the system designer and the computer, and results in much more accurate representations of the way systems behave in the real world. In this paper we examine the decision making process of stock and option trading by the usage of {MACD} (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) technical analysis and Option Pricing with Fuzzy Logic approach. {MACD} technical analysis is for the prediction of the trends of underlying stock prices, such as bearish (going downward), bullish (going upward), and sideways. By using Fuzzy C-Means technique and Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System, we define the decision output where the value of {MACD} is high then decision is “Strong Sell”, and the value of {MACD} is Low then the decision is “Strong Buy”. We also implement the fuzzification of the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula. The stock and options methods are implemented on a portfolio of one stock and its options. Even though the values of input data, such as interest rates, stock price and its volatility, cannot be obtain accurately, these fuzzy methods can give a belief degree of the calculated the Black-Scholes formula so we can make the decision on option trading. The results show the good capability of the methods in the prediction of stock price trends. The performance of the simulated portfolio for a particular period of time also shows good return.},

That model is a diagram of variance from the difference between the random variable that distance h, or γ(h) = Var[Z(s)−Z(s+h)]. Experimental variogram can be calculated through observations at several locations. One model that is chosen to be fitted to ̂γ(h) is the Gaussian. In application, ̂γ(h) often considered to depend on the direction (anisotropic semivariogram). This paper develop a nested Gaussian model by considering some angle intervals which is called geometric anisotropy semivariogram.

	abstract = {The study is intended to investigate the heat loss phenomenon of oil flow in a riser. This heat loss happens due to the difference between the oil temperature in a riser and the surrounding sea water temperature. It causes the formation of wax that may disturb the flow. Heat loss can be reduced by setting up an insulator in a riser or by selecting appropriate pipeline specifications. It is necessary to determine the possible locations and specifications of insulator and pipeline. A mathematical model is formulated by considering the oil temperature and its flow velocity. Assuming that the density variation is small, the fluid behaves as an incompressible fluid. Furthermore, numerical solutions with finite difference methods are presented with some hypothetical data to give an overview of how the system works. Two surrounding conditions are taken into account, i.e. with and without sea current. From the simulation, the location of wax formation can be predicted. At a certain depth region of sea, where the sea current is present, a greater heat loss take place in which wax may be formed immediately. To overcome the formation of wax, we can control the parameters such as conductivity and wall thickness of pipe.},

This link is likely to be mediated by smoking adverse effects on the respiratory defenses. A mathematical model to describe correlation between the number of smokers and its effect on the number of infected people suffer from respiratory disease like influenza is constructed in this paper. Promotion of healthy life is accounted in the model as an optimal control problem to reduce the number of smokers. In this work, the transition rates from smokers to non-smokers and from non-smokers to smokers are regarded as the control variables. Assuming the control variables are constant, equilibrium points of the model can be obtained analytically. The basic reproductive ratio as the endemic threshold is taken from the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix. Using numerical simulation, we show that the healthy life promotion can reduce the number of infected person significantly by reducing the number of smokers. Furthermore, different initial conditions to show different situations in the field are also simulated. It is shown that a large effort to increase the transition rate from smokers to non-smokers and to reduce the transition from non-smokers to smokers should be applied in the endemic reduction scenario.},

Numerical simulation shows the dynamic of each infection compartments which gives a description of within-host dynamic of dengue virus. These results show particularly that infected compartments tend to be vanished in ±15days after the onset of the virus. In fact, without any control added, the haematocrit level will decrease but not up to the normal level. Therefore the effective haematocrit normalization should be done with the treatment control. Control treatment for a fixed time using a control input can bring haematocrit level to normal range 42-47\%. The optimal control in this paper is divided into three cases, i.e. fixed end point, constrained input, and tracking haematocrit state. Each case shows different infection condition in human body.

In practice, the fish farmer could replace the life feed with a formulated feed, which is sold commercially in the store. By experiments conducted by Herath et al (2013), the effect of sudden weaning of angelfish from Artemia sp. to formulated feed is observed with the change in weight of fish during the observation periods. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model describing the growth in weight of fish during this sudden weaning process using logistic model based on data from Herath et al (2013).

	abstract = {Employee Stock Options ({ESOs}) are call options granted by a company to its employees on the stock of the company. {ESOs} are an important part of company compensation and the valuation of these options has become a focus attention in finance and accounting. {ESOs} have special characteristics, such as: they are not tradable; they can be exercised only after the vesting period; if employees leave the company during the vesting period then the {ESOs} are forfeited. So valuing these options using Black-Scholes framework is less appropriate. This paper extends the model proposed by Brisley and Anderson to account for the restricted set of possible exercise dates (Bermudan style) and the state-dependent employee exit rate. We analyze the optimal early exercise decision by risk neutral valuation model. Then the price of {ESOs} is computed using Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method is flexible and easy to implement and modify. We also analyze {ESOs} properties and sensitivity with respect to the model parameters.},

The configuration of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy ({STEM}) in Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy ({ESEM}) provides a novel approach for the characterization of the 3D structure of materials and optimizes a compromise between the resolution level of a few nm and the large tomogram due to the high thickness of transparency. Moreover, {STEM} allows the observation in 2D of wet samples in an {ESEM} by finely controlling the sample temperature and the water pressure of the sample environment. It has been recently demonstrated that it was possible to acquire image series of hydrated objects and thus to attain 3D characterization of wet samples.

The feedback is governed by a complex valued coupling parameter G = {GR} + {iGI}. We calculate the bistability phase diagram within the system's parameter space: spanned by {GR}, {GI}, and Δ, the latter being the detuning between the driving frequency and the transition frequency of the quantum dot. Additionally, switching times from the lower stable branch to the upper one (and vice versa) are calculated as a function of the intensity of the driving field.

Below {TCO}/{OO}, σ1 shows a charge-ordering peak (∼0.8 {eV}) with a significant blue shift as the temperature decreases. Calculations based on a model that incorporates a static Jahn-Teller distortion and assumes the existence of a local charge imbalance between two different sublattices support this assignment and explain the blue shift. This view is further supported by the partial spectral weight analysis showing the onset of optical anisotropy at {TCO}/{OO} in the charge-ordering region (0.5–2.5 {eV}). Interestingly, in the charge-transfer region (2.5–4 {eV}), the spectral weight shows anomalies around the T2D−{AFM} that we attribute to the role of oxygen-p orbitals in stabilizing the {CE}-type magnetic ordering.

	abstract = {We report on the observation of orbital excitations in {YVO}3 by means of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering ({RIXS}) at energies across the vanadium L3 and oxygen K absorption edges. At the V L3 edge, we are able to resolve the full spectrum of orbital excitations up to 5 {eV}. In order to unravel the effect of superexchange interactions and the crystal field on the orbital excitations, we analyzed the energy and temperature dependence of the intra-t2g excitations at 0.1–0.2 {eV} in detail. While these results suggest a dominant influence of the crystal field, peak shifts of about 13–20 {meV} observed as a function of the transferred momentum q∥a reflect a finite dispersion of the orbital excitations. This is puzzling since theoretical models based on superexchange interactions predict a dispersion only for q∥c. Furthermore, we demonstrate that {RIXS} at the O K edge is very sensitive to intersite excitations. At the O K edge, we observe excitations across the Mott-Hubbard gap and an additional feature at 0.4 {eV}, which we attribute to two-orbiton scattering, i.e., an exchange of orbitals between adjacent sites. Altogether, our results indicate that both superexchange interactions and the crystal field are important for a quantitative understanding of the orbital excitations in {YVO}3.},

Since the structure of earth’s conductivity is complex, the scalar {CSAMT} method can lead to a less accurate interpretation. The complex conditions need more sophisticated measurements, such as vector or tensor {CSAMT}, to interpret the data. This paper presents 1D vector {CSAMT} interpretation. A full solution 1D {CSAMT} forward modeling has been developed and used to interpret both vector and scalar {CSAMT} data. Occam’s smoothness constrained inversion was used to test the vector and scalar {CSAMT} interpretations.

	url = {http://www.earthdoc.org/publication/publicationdetails/?publication=73427},
	abstract = {Study of digital rock physics has been through great advancement since the development of X-Ray μ{CT} (micro computed tomography) scanning devices. One of the advantages is that the pore structure of rock can be mapped down to micro-meter scale in 3D. However, to provide better details of the pore structure with the help of high resolution (low spatial resolution per pixel/pixel resolution), such imaging technique produces large size of dataset (in order of Gigabytes). Higher spatial resolution per pixel (lower resolution) will produce smaller size of dataset (in order of hundreds of Megabytes), however, this will risk in losing significant details. This paper describes the effect of spatial resolution both from natural (instrument) resolution and from undersampling of the reconstructed image. From the analysis, we can conclude that lower natural resolution significantly decreases the quality of the produced image, thus exhibit significant risk of losing important details. In contrast to that, lower resolution image obtained from undersampling the reconstructed image do not demonstrate such significant effect to the porosity and specific surface area of the samples. This study is important for prediction of physical properties on wider range of resolution by observing the trend over several resolutions.},

In this study, we carried out the {MD} simulations of the model diatomic molecules in the gas and solution systems to investigate a possible synchronization phenomenon of molecules. The synchronization of vibrational motions of two diatomic molecules was observed in the gas system when the system temperature was controlled by thermostat. In the case of solution system, the synchronization of two molecules was found to depend on the density of solvent particles. These findings indicate that the synchronization of vibrational motion should be induced by the thermostat and the molecular interaction with surrounding solvent and solute molecules.},

The toy model is formed by Gaussian distribution of random number that randomizes distance likesthe distance between particle and central point. The scission process is started by smashing compound nucleus central point into two parts that are left central and right central points. These three points have different Gaussian distribution parameters such as mean (μ{CN}, μL, μR), and standard deviation (σ{CN}, σL, σR). By overlaying of three distributions, the number of particles ({NL}, {NR}) that are trapped by central points can be obtained. This process is iterated until ({NL}, {NR}) become constant numbers.

For the simulation results we concluded that effective corrosion inhibition of iron may be achieved by injection 0.0532 wt\% to 0.1156 wt\% oxygen into liquid lead-bismuth. At this oxygen concentration the structure of iron material will be maintained at about 70\% in bcc crystal structure during interaction with liquid metal.},

The mathematical expressions of tracer's distributions is fitted to experimental data ({TACs}) resulting in model constants. This transport constants represent the urinary system behavior, and later can be used for analyzing system's condition. Different intervals of kinetics parameter are clearly shown by abnormal system with respect to the normal one. Furthermore, the system with delayed uptake has 82\% lower uptake parameters (k1 and k2) than normal one.

	abstract = {Purpose: Non-ionizing radiation therapy for cancer using pulsed electric field with high intensity field has become an interesting field new research topic. A new method using nanosecond pulsed electric fields ({nsPEFs}) offers a novel means to treat cancer. Not like the conventional electroporation, {nsPEFs} able to create nanopores in all membranes of the cell, including membrane in cell organelles, like mitochondria and nucleus. {NsPEFs} will promote cell death in several cell types, including cancer cell by apoptosis mechanism. {NsPEFs} will use pulse with intensity of electric field higher than conventional electroporation, between 20–100 {kV}/cm and with shorter duration of pulse than conventional electroporation. {NsPEFs} requires a generator to produce high voltage pulse and to achieve high intensity electric field with proper pulse width. However, manufacturing cost for creating generator that generates a high voltage with short duration for {nsPEFs} purposes is highly expensive. Hence, the aim of this research is to obtain the low cost generator design that is able to produce a high voltage pulse with nanosecond width and will be used for {nsPEFs} purposes. Method: Cockcroft-Walton multiplier circuit will boost the input of 220 volt {AC} into high voltage {DC} around 1500 volt and it will be combined by a series of power {MOSFET} as a fast switch to obtain a high voltage with nanosecond pulse width. The motivation using Cockcroft-Walton multiplier is to acquire a low-cost high voltage {DC} generator; it will use capacitors and diodes arranged like a step. Power {MOSFET} connected in series is used as voltage divider to share the high voltage in order not to damage them. Results: This design is expected to acquire a low-cost generator that can achieve the high voltage pulse in amount of −1.5 {kV} with falltime 3 ns and risetime 15 ns into a 50Ω load that will be used for {nsPEFs} purposes. Further detailed on the circuit design will be explained at presentation.},

Combining of tungsten trioxide ({WO}3) with titanium dioxide ({TiO}2) have been an interesting research subject because different from conventional {TiO}2 material, this composite can be used and activated under visible-light irradiation and has better photocatalytic efficiency. The purpose of this study was to synthesize composite {WO}3/{TiO}2 nanoparticles and to investigate the detail effect of composition of ammonium metatungstate ({AMT}, as a {WO}3 source) and titanium isopropoxide ({TTIP}, as a {TiO}2 source) in the wide range composition ratio on particle morphology (i.e.,outer size (from 20 to 90nm), shape, and structure), crystallinity, and photocatalytic performance. To synthesize composite {WO}3/{TiO}2 nanoparticles, a flame-assisted spray-pyrolysis method was used. Experimental results showed that the amount of {AMT} (from 0 to 25wt\%) had shown a significant impact on the photocatalytic performance, however deviation of this amount had improve catalyst performance slightly. The change of photocatalytic activity is mainly influenced by band gap energy and surface area. To confirm the fundamental reason for this catalytic improvement, the effect of {WO}3 and {TiO}2 amounts on surface area, light absorbance, and charge separation analysis was investigated. The experimental results were also completed along with the proposal photocatalytic mechanism of particles containing {WO}3 and {TiO}2. In addition, although our present photocatalytic activity still needs to be improved, the present results open new information for creating more varied properties for application explorations.},

We found that the {GQDs} have an optimum reaction time and require an effective precursor to achieve excellent luminescent properties. The {PL}, ultraviolet-visible ({UV}-vis) absorption, zeta potential, and nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) analyses of the {GQDs} prepared at various reaction times revealed that the molecular structures responsible for the luminescence of the {GQDs} are aggregates or condensation products of citric acid amides. We found that urea addition to the precursor drastically enhances the {PL} intensity of the {GQDs}, and it is 40 times higher than those prepared using the pure citric acid precursor. Additionally, a {GQDs}–polyvinyl alcohol composite achieved an excellent quantum yield ({QY}) of 43.6\%.},

We will treat a relative easy example of melting process to test the method in solving fluid motion equation coupled by heat transfer process. The main heat transfer processes are caused by solid-liquid (medium to medium) heat diffusion and convection. System interaction with ambient temperature can be modeled by gas surrounding fluid-solid system. For the ambient temperature, we proposed surface particle heat transfer governed by convectional heat flux. Using local particle number density value as surface detection method, we applied cooling and heating to surface particle on the melting ice cube and water system.

Adding an extra Hamiltonian gives a non-trivial result compared to the normal {AQC}, however it does not result in a speed-up.

	abstract = {Recycling option of spent nuclear fuels ({SFN}) from the reactors is one of the hot issues in term of fuel utilization of recycling fuel for extending sustainability of nuclear fuel as well as nuclear non-proliferation because of plutonium utilization. The potential risk of plutonium utilization can be reduced by maintaining the isotopic plutonium barrier. Plutonium barrier can be increased by producing more even-mass plutonium isotopes or by increasing the irradiation time process which can burn much more fissile material in the reactors. The present study intends to analyze some important aspects of isotopic material barrier of plutonium composition based on the composition of spent nuclear fuel of light water reactors ({LWRs}). Some parameters of material barrier are evaluated such as decay heat ({DH}) and spontaneous fission neutron ({SFN}) which depends on plutonium isotopic compositions. The results show that increased production of even-mass plutonium (Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242) can be easily achieved by increasing the burnup level, which also effectively reduces fissile Pu-239 production because more fissile material is consumed. Higher {DH} from even-mass plutonium can be achieved with higher burnup and longer cooling time because of high contribution of individual decay heat properties of even-mass plutonium especially from Pu-238 contribution. In addition, higher {SFN} composition can be obtained with a higher burnup level and longer cooling time, which is mainly due to the Pu-240 contribution. Higher burnup and longer cooling time are effective for increasing the even-mass plutonium composition. It is explained that higher irradiation process and cooling times are effective for increasing the proliferation resistance level of plutonium due to the level of even-mass plutonium as well as increasing the decay heat and spontaneous fission neutron as material barrier parameters.},

The objective is to clarify and also to extend the current modeling of cross flow pressure drop coefficient employed in subchannel analysis method. This study includes both pure laminar and fully turbulent flow conditions. Firstly, simulations employing pin pitch to diameter ratio (P/D) of 1.21 are carried out, and the results are compared with available experimental data in terms of wire correction parameter. The results for P/D=1.21 are in good agreement with experimental data. Calculations employing smaller values of P/D, representing tight lattice rod configuration, have also been carried out. Based on the numerical results, new correlations of cross flow pressure drop are proposed. The correlations can be used to evaluate cross flow pressure drop coefficient in subchannel analysis codes.},

A pump storage system is the center in the integration among considered energy sources. Using this system many renewable energy sources and the small nuclear power plant can be integrated to produce reliable energy sources which can be used for electricity production, desalination, etc. In this system each energy source can store energy by contributing pumping water from a low level reservoir to a high level reservoir. The nuclear power plant module must satisfy inherent safety requirement, and have flexibility in producing electricity, clean water (through desalination), etc. The reactor can be operated for 25 years without the necessity to refuel during that period. To achieve inherent safety capability it is important to minimized excess reactivity during burn-up to be below delayed neutron fraction value so that super prompt critical accident such as in Chernobyl accident case can be avoided. Here minimization of excess reactivity is carried out by adjusting core and blanket region width and plutonium enrichment in core regions.},

Full-multiplet calculations indicate that the differences in the magnetic behavior of α- and γ-{CoV}2O6 phases originate from different local distortions of the {CoO}6 octahedra. In particular, the strong compression of the {CoO}6 octahedra together with the unusually small octahedral crystal field splitting in α-{CoV}2O6 lead to a strong mixture of t2g and eg orbitals which, via the local atomic Coulomb and exchange interactions, results in an exceptionally large orbital moment.},

Going beyond the restricted case of nondissipative and nondispersive scatterers often reported previously, the current numerical calculation is performed directly on the basis of Mie's general formula, adopting the refractive index data of Johnson and Christy. Our result does not show the appearance of well resolved and multipole resonances in Qsca plotted against q(= 2πa/λ), for certain wire radii. It does show however, the growing contributions of the higher order modes as a increases. A series of closely-placed but well separated resonance curves nevertheless show up for varying wire radii within the range of small q, exhibiting systematic changes indicative of the size effects on the scattered waves. The further deduced Qsca(λ) spectra display the distinct resonance curves for different wire radii showing peculiar mix of monotonous and nonmonotonous variations of the resonance peak and spectral width with increasing a, as a result of complicated competitions among the growing contributions of the higher order modes. Finally, while the silver and gold scatterers appear to exhibit qualitatively similar behaviors, they differ largely in details due to the significantly different indices of refraction and dispersive properties.},

Specifically, the Rosenbloom–Tsfasman weight for vector codes satisfies the extension theorem, whereas the Niederreiter–Rosenbloom–Tsfasman weight for matrix codes does not. A short character-theoretic proof of the well-known {MacWilliams} extension theorem for the homogeneous weight is provided.

The basic mosquito offspring number is obtained and analysis of equilibria is shown. We bring along a discussion on application of optimal control model which engineers two simultaneous schemes. The first scheme is done by disseminating chemical like Temephos in spots where eggs and larvae develop, meanwhile the second scheme is done by conducting fumigation through areas where adult mosquitoes prevalently nest, indoor as well as outdoor. A version of gradient-based method is presented to set down a workflow in minimizing the objective functional with respect to control variable. Numerical results from analysis of the basic mosquito offspring number with constant control and from optimal control suggest that one has to enhance the usage of fumigation rather than Temephos. It is also suggested that applying both control schemes simultaneously gives the most significant reduction to the population.},

Mathematical analysis of the mathematical model revealed a threshold parameter denoted by alternative reproduction ratio with three different cycles of generations of secondary {HIV} infections, namely (i) cycle from infected {CD}\$4{\textasciicircum}+\$ T cells to free virus and back to infected {CD}\$4{\textasciicircum}+\$ T cells, (ii) cycle from infected {CD}\$4{\textasciicircum}+\$ T cells to infected Langerhans cells and back to infected {CD}\$4{\textasciicircum}+\$ T cells, and (iii) cycle from infected {CD}\$4{\textasciicircum}+\$ T cells to free virus to infected Langerhans cells and back to infected {CD}\$4{\textasciicircum}+\$ T cells. The relationship between the alternative reproduction ratio and the basic reproduction ratio showed that the predictions of results using the alternative reproduction ratio could be easily inferred from those of the basic reproduction ratio. Each of the cycles of infection raised the viral load whenever they were a dominant mechanism of viral production. The viral degradation mechanism, an antagonistic mechanism to viral lysis, was shown to slow down the growth of the virus.},

X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) revealed that the {MSN} prepared under the highest microwave power ({MSN}450) produced the most crystallized and prominent mesoporous structure. Enhancement of the crystal growth improved the hexagonal order and range of silica, which led to greater surface area, pore width and pore volume. {MSN}450exhibited higher ibuprofen adsorption (98.3mg/g), followed by {MSN}300(81.3mg/g) and {MSN}100(74.1mg/g), confirming that more crystallized {MSN} demonstrated higher adsorptivity toward ibuprofen. Significantly, {MSN}450 also contained more hydroxyl groups that provided more adsorption sites. In addition, {MSN}450 exhibited comparable ibuprofen adsorption with conventionally synthesized {MSN}, indicating the potential of microwave treatment in the synthesis of related porous materials. In vitrodrug release was also investigated with simulated biological fluids and the kinetics was studied under different {pH} conditions. {MSN}450showed the slowest release rate of ibuprofen, followed by {MSN}300 and {MSN}100. This was due to the wide pore diameter and longer range of silica order of the {MSN}450. Ibuprofen release from {MSN}450 at {pH} 5 and 7 was found to obey a zero-order kinetic model, while release at {pH} 2 followed the Kosmeyer–Peppas model.},

The nitrogen physisorption and pyrrole adsorbed {IR} spectroscopy results indicated that the high activity of Ni/{MSN} is due to the presence of both intra- and inter-particle porosity which led to the high concentration of basic sites. In addition, the correlation between N–H band intensity and the turnover frequency revealed that the methanation activity increased with increasing of the concentration of basic sites. The presence of defect sites or oxygen vacancies in {MSN} was responsible for the formation of surface carbon species, while Ni sites dissociated hydrogen to form atomic hydrogen. The surface carbon species then interacted with atomic hydrogen to form methane. The Ni/{MSN} catalyst performed with good stability and no deactivation up to 200h.},

The activity of the catalysts was tested for cumene conversion in a pulse microcatalytic reactor at 323–573K. {XRD}, {TEM} and N2 physisorption results confirmed the hexagonal ordered structure with a pore diameter of 3.4–4.0nm, a particle size of 70–120nm and a surface area of 588–995m2/g. Solid state {NMR} and {IR} results confirmed that the aluminum grafting and protonation form framework and extra-framework aluminums which led to generating strong Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. High activity in the cumene conversion was only observed on {HAlMSN} producing propylene, benzene, toluene via a cracking on protonic acid sites and producing a main product of α-methylstyrene via a dehydrogenation on Lewis acidic sites at high reaction temperature. While only α-methylstyrene and higher hydrocarbon (⩾C10) were produced at low reaction temperature showing the permanent Brønsted acid sites did not involve in the cumene conversion. It is suggested that the presence of hydrogen and strong Lewis acid sites increased the stability and activity of the {HAlMSN} catalyst in the cumene conversion. Although the small deactivation of {HAlMSN} was observed during the reaction due to the formation of small coke deposits on the surface, the reactivation recovered the activity of catalyst and the high activity was still observed after 60h of reaction. The high stability and activity of {HAlMSN} in the cumene conversion can be considered as a method for the production of α-methylstyrene via a dehydrogenation process.},

Experiments were carried out as a function of contact time, dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, {pH}, and temperature. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips adsorption isotherm models were applied to describe isotherm parameters. The results showed that equilibrium contact time was 90 min. The experimental results indicate that, the percentage of dye adsorption increases with an increase in the adsorbent dosages and temperature. The {CR} adsorption percentage decreased with increasing dye concentration and {pH} solution from 3 to 12. Thermodynamic parameters data indicated that the {CR} adsorption process was non-spontaneous and endothermic under the experimental conditions, with the Gibbs free energy (∆G°) in the range of 9.13–8.12 {kJ}/mol, enthalpy (∆H°) and entropy (∆S°) of 14.15 {kJ}/mol and 16.85 J/mol, respectively. The Langmuir isotherm model fit the equilibrium data better than both the Freundlich and Sips isotherm models, with adsorption capacity 9.82 mg/g. The kinetic data for adsorption processes were described by pseudo-second-order model with a rate constant in the range of 0.043–0.156 g mg/g min−1.

The measurements permit the identification of the spectral occupancy over those selected sites in reference to the allocated radio spectrum in Indonesia. The sites are in close proximity to Australia, the future host of Square Kilometre Array ({SKA}) at low frequency. Therefore, the survey was deliberately made to approximately adhere the {SKA} protocol for {RFI} measurements, but with lower sensitivity. The {RFI} environment at Bosscha Observatory in Lembang was also measured for comparison. Within the sensitivity limit of the measurement equipment, it is found that a location called Fatumonas in the surrounding of Mount Timau in West Timor has very low level of {RFI}, with a total spectrum occupancy in this measured frequency range being about 1 \%, mostly found at low frequency below 20 {MHz}.

A set of control systems are required in order to operate a fuel cell based power plant system optimally. For the purpose of control system design, an accurate fuel cell stack model in describing the dynamics of the real system is needed. Currently, linear model are widely used for fuel cell stack control purposes, but it has limitations in narrow operation range. While nonlinear models lead to nonlinear control implemnetation whos more complex and hard computing. In this research, nonlinear cancellation technique will be used to transform a nonlinear model into a linear form while maintaining the nonlinear characteristics. The transformation is done by replacing the input of the original model by a certain virtual input that has nonlinear relationship with the original input. Then the equality of the two models is tested by running a series of simulation. Input variation of H2, O2 and H2O as well as disturbance input I (current load) are studied by simulation. The error of comparison between the proposed model and the original nonlinear model are less than 1 \%. Thus we can conclude that nonlinear cancellation technique can be used to represent fuel cell nonlinear model in a simple linear form while maintaining the nonlinear characteristics and therefore retain the wide operation range.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a new approach for investigating the seismic wave velocity of rock, specifically carbonates, as affected by their pore structures. While the conventional routine of seismic velocity measurement highly depends on the extensive laboratory experiment, the proposed approach utilizes the digital rock physics view which lies on the numerical experiment. Thus, instead of using core sample, we use the thin section image of carbonate rock to measure the effective seismic wave velocity when travelling on it. In the numerical experiment, thin section images act as the medium on which wave propagation will be simulated. For the modeling, an advanced technique based on artificial neural network was employed for building the velocity and density profile, replacing image's {RGB} pixel value with the seismic velocity and density of each rock constituent. Then, ultrasonic wave was simulated to propagate in the thin section image by using finite difference time domain method, based on assumption of an acoustic-isotropic medium. Effective velocities were drawn from the recorded signal and being compared to the velocity modeling from Wyllie time average model and Kuster-Toksoz rock physics model. To perform the modeling, image analysis routines were undertaken for quantifying the pore aspect ratio that is assumed to represent the rocks pore structure. In addition, porosity and mineral fraction required for velocity modeling were also quantified by using integrated neural network and image analysis technique. It was found that the Kuster-Toksoz gives the closer prediction to the measured velocity as compared to the Wyllie time average model. We also conclude that Wyllie time average that does not incorporate the pore structure parameter deviates significantly for samples having more than 40\% porosity. Utilizing this approach we found a good agreement between numerical experiment and theoretically derived rock physics model for estimating the effective seismic wave velocity of rock.},

The main purposes of this paper are to find how the change of interest rate affects economic growth and to use the relationship in prognostication of economic growth. By using expenditure model, a linear relationship between economic growth and interest rate is developed. The result is then used for prediction by normal copula and Vine Archimedean copula. It is shown that increasing interest rate to tackle inflation is a poor solution.

In this paper, the weekly red-chili prices secondary-data of five main traditional markets in Bandung are used as case study. The purpose of {GSTAR}(1,1) model is to forecast the next time red-chili prices at those markets. The model is identified by sample space-time {ACF} and space-time {PACF}, and model parameters are estimated by least square estimation method. Theoretically, the errors’ independency assumption could simplify the parameter estimation’s problem. However, practically that assumption is hard to satisfy since the errors may be correlated each other’s. In red-chili prices modeling, it is considered that the process has time-correlated errors, i.e. martingale difference process, instead of follow normal distribution. Here, we do some simulations to investigate the behavior of errors’ assumptions. Although some of results show that the behavior of the errors’ model are not always followed the martingale difference process, it does not corrupt the goodness of {GSTAR}(1,1) model to forecast the red-chili prices at those five markets.},

	abstract = {Customer Lifetime Value is an important and useful concept in marketing. One of its benefits is to help a company for budgeting marketing expenditure for customer acquisition and customer retention. Many mathematical models have been introduced to calculate {CLV} considering the customer retention/migration classification scheme. A fairly new class of these models which will be described in this paper uses Markov Chain Models ({MCM}). This class of models has the major advantage for its flexibility to be modified to several different cases/classification schemes. In this model, the probabilities of customer retention and acquisition play an important role. From Pfeifer and Carraway, 2000, the final formula of {CLV} obtained from {MCM} usually contains nonlinear form of the transition probability matrix. This nonlinearity makes the inverse problem of {CLV} difficult to solve. This paper aims to solve this inverse problem, yielding the approximate transition probabilities for the customers, by applying metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed by Yang, 2013, Flower Pollination Algorithm. The major interpretation of obtaining the transition probabilities are to set goals for marketing teams in keeping the relative frequencies of customer acquisition and customer retention.},

	abstract = {Nowadays some firms, including insurer firms, think that customer-centric services are better than product-centric ones in terms of marketing. Insurance firms will try to attract as many new customer as possible while maintaining existing customer. This causes the Customer Lifetime Value ({CLV}) becomes a very important thing. {CLV} are able to put customer into different segments and calculate the present value of a firm’s relationship with its customer. Insurance customer will depend on the last service he or she can get. So if the service is bad now, then customer will not renew his contract though the service is very good at an erlier time. Because of this situation one suitable mathematical model for modeling customer’s relationships and calculating their lifetime value is Markov Chain. In addition, the advantages of using Markov Chain Modeling is its high degree of flexibility. In 2000, Pfeifer and Carraway states that Markov Chain Modeling can be used for customer retention situation. In this situation, Markov Chain Modeling requires only two states, which are present customer and former ones. This paper calculates customer lifetime value in an insurance firm with two distinctive interest rates; the constant interest rate and uniform distribution of interest rates. The result shows that loyal customer and the customer who increase their contract value have the highest {CLV}.},

The momentum conservative scheme pursued here is shown to be suitable for 1D problems such as transcritical flow with a shock and dam break over a rectangular bed, and we also found that our simulation of dam break over a dry sloping bed is in good agreement with the exact solution. Further, the results obtained using the generalised momentum conservative approximation for 2D shallow water equations to simulate wave run up on a conical island are in good agreement with benchmark experimental data.},

The probability distribution is developed by fitting historical departure delay data of an airline to a number of probability distributions. Then, we choose the most fitted model by applying two-stage Genetic Algorithm. In the first stage, the algorithm works for maximizing log-likelihood function, and then we proceed to the second stage by facing the optimization model for minimizing the sum of squared error. The second stage is intended to avoid getting trapped in a local optimal solution which often occurs in log-likelihood approach. Since the historical data show that at a certain time in a day a flight has a bigger probability to be delayed, we also analyze the probability distribution of flight departure delay-time by using a similar approach for distribution of flight departure delay duration. The distributions can be used by the airline for measuring the sensitivity of flight schedules, so that a robust flight schedule can be constructed.},

A simple model using simulation was designed to approach this complex system. This study aimed at implementing the Monte Carlo simulation for investigation
the urinary system based on the kinetic theory. {MCell} as Monte Carlo simulation was used to analyze the compartment model for urinary system. Urinary system was created in two models. One was three compartments with blood and bladder compartment same dimension and another model was with blood
compartment smaller than bladder compartment. Simulation with blood and bladder compartment same dimension showed similar result with experiment of renography. The result with blood compartment, smaller than bladder showed the diffusion process faster than another model. This simulation indicated

The temperature evolution of phonon modes revealed structural alterations in {PBT} occurred near 800, 600, and 400 K. The paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition at 800 K was clearly observed in the temperature behavior of the low-energy phonon mode at 60 cm−1 that has been previously attributed to a displacement of the Bi2O2 plane with respect to the Aurivillius perovskite-like block, emphasizing that this is the phonon mode driving the system into a ferroelectric state. The structural transformation near 600 K was identified from the mode at 40 cm−1 related to Pb/Bi vibrations in the perovskite-like block as well as modes at 130 and 220 cm−1 caused by octahedral tilting of {TiO}6. The temperature of this structural alteration matches the second anomaly observed in the dielectric permittivity of {PBT}, so it causes minor spontaneous polarization in this material. The temperature dependence of the mode at 60 cm−1 also revealed a structural transformation at 400 K that is not related to the ferroelectric properties of {PBT}.},

The purified α-amylase variants demonstrated starch hydrolysis resulting in a mixture of maltose, maltotriose, and glucose, similar to the wild type enzyme. Introduction of the disulphide bridge shifted the melting temperature ({TM}) from 54.5 to 56°C and nearly tripled the enzyme half-life time at 65°C. The two variants have similar kcat/{KM} values. Similarly, inhibition by acarbose was only slightly affected, with the {IC}50 of Sfamy02 for acarbose being 40±3.4{μM}, while that of Sfamy01 was 31±3.9{μM}. On the other hand, the {IC}50 of Sfamy02 for {EDTA} was 0.45mM, nearly two times lower than that of Sfamy01 at 0.77mM. These results show that the introduction of a disulphide bridge had little effect on the enzyme activity, but made the enzyme more susceptible to calcium ion extraction. Altogether, the new disulphide bridge improved the enzyme stability without affecting its activity, although minor changes in the active site environment cannot be excluded.},

	abstract = {Enhanced oil recovery ({EOR}) in the last several years has become an important factor in oil production due to the shortfall in high quality crude oil. Heavy oil as one of the unconventional hydrocarbons is still vastly abundant in nature and is hence frequently explored with {EOR}. The viscous characteristic of heavy oil necessitates further in-situ upgrading processes to be executed before extraction. An interesting upgrading method is through aquathermolysis under the addition of catalyst. This review focuses on presenting nanoparticle catalysts, such as nickel-, iron- and cobalt-based nanocatalyst. The explanation covers topics from synthesis methods and characterization up to the effect of reducing the viscosity of heavy oil. Lastly, concluding remarks and future perspectives are highlighted regarding the visibility and available approaches of developing nanofluids for {EOR}.},

	abstract = {The Pt nanoparticles have been synthesized in situ using bacterial cellulose ({BC}) membranes as the matrix. The {BC} was immersed in a solution of {PtCl}4 and H2PtCl6 as Pt({IV}) precursors also in surfactant stabilized Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes ({MWCNT}) as carbon source. Then, the Pt({IV}) was reduced by hydrogen gas. Two routes have been applied for the insertion Pt particles; in the first route the Pt particles were inserted before the insertion of {MWCNT} and in the second route the other way around was applied. The products of these two insertion routes for each precursor are designated as {BC}-{PtPtCl}4-{MWCNT}, {BC}-{PtH}2PtCl6-{MWCNT} for the first route and {BC}-{MWCNT}-{PtPtCl}4, {BC}-{MWCNT}-{PtH}2PtCl6 for the second route, respectively. Both routes revealed that the Pt particles insertion in {BC} depends on the type of precursors and insertion routes, as seen from the morphology and Pt particles content. The first route produces Pt diameter of 26 nm while the second one 42 nm. The use of {PtCl}4 in the first route resulted in higher content of Pt particles (50\%) compared to H2PtCl6 (39\%). On the other hand, the type of precursor did not give any significant effect to the content of Pt inserted; both gave 29\% of Pt to the second route. The high Pt content observed on the {BC}-{PtPtCl}4-{MWCNT} membrane surface is possible because {PtCl}4 precursor forms H2[{PtCl}4({OH})2] that initially can be bound via hydrogen bonding to the {BC} backbone. It is concluded that smaller size and high content of Pt particles have been obtained from {PtCl}4 precursor, the distribution of Pt particles and {MWCNT} are almost homogenous in the {BC}-{PtPtCl}4-{MWCNT} membrane derived from precursor {PtCl}4.},

	abstract = {Organic solar cells have been much studied because of the simplicity in their fabrication process in comparison to solar cells based on crystalline inorganic semiconductors. However, the actual power conversion efficiency is still much lower than the theoretical prediction, which may indicate the effect of inefficient charge transfer or charge recombination loss inside the cell. We have studied the photovoltaic characteristics of hybrid solar cells with transition metal doped {ZnO} layer as electron transport layers. Under dark condition, their J-V curves show a deviation from an ideal diode characteristic, which is indicated by current flow below the threshold voltage. Further investigations to clarify the photovoltaic characteristics of those cells were then carried out by the measurements of impedance spectroscopy. The impedance characteristics are dependent on the transport layer used, where the Nyquist plots of cells with {TiZO} exhibit larger impedance than those of cells with {ZnO}. However, those cells with larger impedance show better working performances. This fact was then interpreted as the result from smaller interfacial charge transfer loss, which may take place via charge carrier recombination at the interface of the transport layer and active layer, in the cells with {TiZO}.},

The emission wavelength of the phosphors varied with the mixing ratio of raw materials and it was found that lowering the proportion of urea to boric acid or citric acid tended to increase the internal quantum yield and shorten the emission wavelength under excitation at 365nm. It was also found for the first time that a light-emitting polymer could be synthesized from a mixture of the prepared {BCNO} nanoparticles and a polyvinyl alcohol. This polymer composite exhibited uniform dispersion and stabilization of the luminescence and had a high internal quantum yield of 54\%, which was higher than that of the phosphor alone.},

	abstract = {A Raman spectroscopy study on the half-doped single-layer manganite Pr0.5Ca1.5MnO4 has been performed in combination with x-ray diffraction, resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The results provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of phenomena that arise from correlations between lattice, charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom. The appearance of a new Raman mode at 366cm−1, a visible jump in the resistivity, and a doubling of the unit cell signify the onset of charge/orbital ordering at 320 K. This transition is also marked by a sharp peak in the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat, suggesting strong spin-charge coupling. Our structural analysis suggests that the charge disproportionation below 320 K is small. Orbital fluctuations below 320 K are evidenced by the evolution with temperature of the Jahn-Teller Raman mode (situated at 533cm−1 at 320 K). A coincidence between the onset of two-dimensional short-range antiferromagnetic order at 215 K and anomalies in both the temperature dependence of the Jahn-Teller mode and the Mn-O bonding pattern in the ab plane indicate that the short-range magnetic order plays a role in stabilizing the orbital fluctuations. Below the Néel temperature of 127 K, the softening of both the 366cm−1 mode and an octahedral tilting mode at 214cm−1 mark the onset of three-dimensional antiferromagnetic ordering. The estimated spin-phonon coupling constants for these two modes are 2.6 and 6.8cm−1, respectively. This study highlights the remarkable coupling of charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom to the lattice in single-layer Pr0.5Ca1.5MnO4.},

	url = {https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2015/206131/abs/},
	abstract = {Estimating the basic reproductive ratio of dengue fever has continued to be an ever-increasing challenge among epidemiologists. In this paper we propose two different constructions to estimate which is derived from a dynamical system of host-vector dengue transmission model. The construction is based on the original assumption that in the early states of an epidemic the infected human compartment increases exponentially at the same rate as the infected mosquito compartment (previous work). In the first proposed construction, we modify previous works by assuming that the rates of infection for mosquito and human compartments might be different. In the second construction, we add an improvement by including more realistic conditions in which the dynamics of an infected human compartments are intervened by the dynamics of an infected mosquito compartment, and vice versa. We apply our construction to the real dengue epidemic data from {SB} Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, during the period of outbreak Nov. 25, 2008–Dec. 2012. We also propose two scenarios to determine the take-off rate of infection at the beginning of a dengue epidemic for construction of the estimates of : scenario I from equation of new cases of dengue with respect to time (daily) and scenario {II} from equation of new cases of dengue with respect to cumulative number of new cases of dengue. The results show that our first construction of accommodates the take-off rate differences between mosquitoes and humans. Our second construction of the estimation takes into account the presence of infective mosquitoes in the early growth rate of infective humans and vice versa. We conclude that the second approach is more realistic, compared with our first approach and the previous work.},

The front-tracking method is used to solve numerically the free boundary motion of the interface. To maintain the conservation of mass during the numerical procedure, a weighted factor with a certain condition is introduced to calculate the update surfactant concentration, for each iteration. Results show that the surfactant affects the drop to accelerate its detachment from the solid substrate, and the slip coefficient turns out to be the crucial factor for the magnitude of the contact line movement.},

The critical behavior of the average hyperfine field at the phase transition at about 14 K further supports a three-dimensional model for the magnetism in this compound. Moreover, using nuclear inelastic scattering by the 57Fe Mössbauer resonance, Fe-specific lattice dynamics are found to be strongly anisotropic with stiffer bonds in the ab plane of the crystal. The powder averaged, Fe partial density of phonon states can be well modeled using ab initio calculations and low-energy phonons are found to deviate from classical Debye-like behavior, indicating spin-phonon coupling in this compound.

The oxidation study of palm oil is conducted in the presence of zeolite nanocrystals (0.5 wt \%) at 150 °C. Several characterization techniques such as visual analysis, colorimetry, rheometry, total acid number ({TAN}), {FT}-{IR} spectroscopy, 1H {NMR} spectroscopy, and Karl Fischer analyses are applied to follow the oxidative evolution of the oil. It was found that zeolite nanocrystals decelerate the oxidation of palm oil through stabilization of hydroperoxides, which are the primary oxidation product, and concurrently via adsorption of the secondary oxidation products (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters). In addition to the experimental results, periodic density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations are performed to elucidate further the oxidation process of the palm oil in the presence of zeolite nanocrystals. The {DFT} calculations show that the metal complexes formed with peroxides are more stable than the complexes with alkenes with the same ions. The peroxides captured in the zeolite X nanocrystals consequently decelerate further oxidation toward formation of acids. Unlike the monovalent alkali metal cations in the zeolite X nanocrystals (K+, Na+, and Li+), Ca2+ reduced the acidity of the oil by neutralizing the acidic carboxylate compounds to {COO}–(Ca2+)1/2 species.},

Antioxidants are probably the most important additives used in oils because oxidative deterioration plays a major role in oil degradation. Zeolite nanoparticles ({NPs}) have been proven as another option as green antioxidants in oil formulation. The anti-oxidative behavior of zeolite {NPs} is obvious; however, the phenomenon is still under investigation. Herein, a study of the effect of extra-framework cations stabilized on Linde Type L ({LTL}) zeolite {NPs} (ca. 20 nm) on inhibition of oxidation in palm oil-based lubricant oil is reported. Hydrophilic {LTL} zeolites with a Si/Al ratio of 3.2 containing four different inorganic cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+) were applied. The oxidation of the lubricant oil was followed by visual observation, colorimetry, fourier transform infrared ({FTIR}) spectroscopy, 1H {NMR} spectroscopy, total acid number ({TAN}), and rheology analyses. The effect of extra-framework cations to slow down the rate of oil oxidation and to control the viscosity of oil is demonstrated. The degradation rate of the lubricant oil samples is decreased considerably as the polarizability of cation is increased with the presence of zeolite {NPs}. More importantly, the microporous zeolite {NPs} have a great influence in halting the steps that lead to the polymerization of the oils and thus increasing the lifetime of oils.},

The {MIPs} were prepared with methyl methacrylate as a monomer, {HA} as templates, ethylene glycoldimethacrylate as a cross-linker, and dimethyl formamide as a solvent. The characteristics of {MIPs} were evaluated using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller methods. The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips models were applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms using non-linear regression analysis. Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticles, and Boyd kinetic models were used to describe the kinetic data. The results showed that the equilibrium contact time was 60 min. The experimental results indicated that the percentage of sorption increases with an increase in the adsorbent dosage and temperature. The adsorption percentage decreased with increasing peat water {pH} from 2 to 12. The equilibrium data fitted well for the Langmuir adsorption isotherms, with monolayer adsorption capacity of {MIPs} found to be 45.45 mg/g. The results of the kinetic study show that the adsorption of {HA} onto {MIPs} could be described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with a rate constant in the range of 0.034–0.115 g/mg min and controlled by film diffusion, with the effective diffusion coefficient was found in the range of 7.42 × 10−8–13.84 × 10−8 cm2/s.

The effects of {pH}, adsorbent dosage, agitation time, initial {HA} concentration, and temperatures on {HA} adsorption were evaluated. The adsorption of {HA} onto nano-particles followed the Sips isotherm and pseudo-second order kinetics models. Thermodynamic parameters data indicated that the {HA} adsorption process was non-spontaneous and endothermic under the experimental conditions. The adsorption of {HA} from peat water (the real sample) using the nano-particles demonstrated that they were an adsorbent with great potential for the removal of {HA} from peat water.},

	abstract = {Oxides like ceria ({CeO}2) are very promising for solid electrolyte materials when doped by suitable aliovalent dopants, as they introduce high oxygen ion conduction leading to intermediate to low temperature operations (T ≤ 800°C ). Over the past decades, engineering new compositions aiming at high ionic conductivity at lower operating temperatures has been a key issue of developing solid oxide fuel cells. However, the understanding over the underlying physics on the oxygen ion conduction in this system remains unclear. In this work, we discuss our {DFT}+U study on the effect of the 4f-electrons on Pr-doped {CeO}2. We found that, regardless of their localized nature tendency, we found significant contributions from the Pr-dopant 4f-electrons to the oxygen vacancy formation energy as well as the preferential site of the oxygen vacancy formation in comparison with the model of fully localized 4f-electrons, though the geometrical properties for each local minimum structure remain unaffected.},

	abstract = {Under external electric field, a free standing silicene monolayer is investigated for the physical and electronic features using the density functional theory with norm-conserving pseudopotentials and pseudo-atomic localized basis functions. It is found that silicene tends to be flat instead of buckled as applying electric field perpendicular to the surface. We observed on some range magnitude of electric field and noticed that there is a monotonic decreasing in number of {DOS} near the Fermi level showing the possibility of tunable bandgap on silicene. We also found that in this higher magnitude electric field, the Dirac cone is no longer occurring at K-point while the band gap term remains direct. The asymmetry onsite potential between the Si atom at site A and B spoils the degeneracy at the K point by the presence of external or internal influence. In this work, we try to combine those influences by considering Stone Wales ({SW}) defect and outer z-direction of electric field as internal and external factors respectively. A non-linear correlation of the result is profoundly becoming more effective way in effort to bring remarkable band-gap in silicene monolayer.},

Calculation shows that single V atom situated
on the hexagonal site of graphene is the most stable configuration, where the covalent interaction is more pronounced. The projected density of states ({PDOS}) is also computed around the Fermi level. It is found that the covalent bonding of carbon and vanadium is mainly contributed by 2p
z
orbital of carbon and partially by the 3d like orbitals. For vanadium dimer, the stable configuration is found to be perpendicular dimer situated on the center of the hexagon. This stable vanadium dimer configuration which has not been reported in the previous works has shown enhancement
of magnetic moment per unit cell compared to an isolated dimer. The {PDOS} computed shows similar proportion in terms of orbital contribution as the in the case of a single vanadium atom. Moreover, vanadium dimer bond length for the favored configuration after relaxation is the same as the experimental
value of isolated dimer’s bond length indicating that perpendicular chain might be possible on graphene sheet. Thus, this study reveals that the vanadium atoms adsorbed graphene system is metallic and magnetic.},

Moreover, different plasmon modes are observed in the center and edge of the single Bi2Te3 nanoplate and a breathing mode is discovered for the first time in a non-noble metal. Theoretical calculations show that the plasmons observed in the visible range are mainly due to strong spin–orbit coupling induced metallic surface states of Bi2Te3.

Two molecular mimics, a mixture of reduced {BDMCs} and 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone ({HPB}), have been synthesized and applied as templates for {MIP} synthesis. The polymers were prepared using N-(2-aminoethyl) methacrylamide ({EAMA}) as functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ({EDMA}) as the cross-linker (in a 1:5 molar ratio), and a mixture of acetonitrile/dimethylsulfoxide (90 \%, v/v) as porogen. {MIPs} prepared using a mixture of reduced {BDMCs} as template showed higher selectivity for {CUR} and {BDMC} than those obtained with {HPB}, with imprinting factors of 3.5 and 2.7 for {CUR} and {BDMC}, respectively, using H2O/acetonitrile (65:35, v/v) as mobile phase. The adsorption isotherms for {CUR} in the {MIP} and the nonimprinted polymer ({NIP}) were fitted to the Freundlich isotherm model, and the calculated average binding affinities for {CUR} were (17 ± 2) and (8 ± 1) {mM}−1 for the {MIP} and the {NIP}, respectively. The polymers were packed into solid-phase extraction ({SPE}) cartridges, and the optimized molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction ({MISPE}-{HPLC}) with fluorescence detection ({FLD}) method allowed the extraction of both curcuminoids from aqueous samples (50 {mM} {NH}4Ac, {pH} 8.8) followed by a selective washing with acetonitrile/{NH}4Ac, 50 {mM} at {pH} 8.8 (30:70 \%, v/v), and elution with 3 × 1 {mL} of {MeOH}. Good recoveries and precision ranging between 87 and 92 \%, with relative standard deviation ({RSD}) of {\textless}5.3 \% (n = 3), were obtained after the preconcentration of 10-{mL} solutions containing both {CUR} and {BDMC} at concentrations in the range of 0–500 μg L−1.

	abstract = {Bifunctional mesoporous silica nanomaterials ({MSN}) with various Si/Al molar ratios of 7, 10, 20 and 50 in platinum supported (Pt/{HAlMSN}) were synthesized using sol–gel methods followed by post-synthesis methods. {XRD} and nitrogen sorption results confirmed the mesoporous structure with surface areas of 537–775 m2 g−1. 27Al {NMR} spectroscopy confirmed aluminium loading with tetrahedral, pentahedral and octahedral structures. Pyridine adsorption {IR} results indicated that incorporation of aluminium led to the generation of strong Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. Catalytic activity was investigated for cumene hydrocracking in a pulse microcatalytic reactor in the temperature range of 323–573 K which revealed that this activity depends on the number of Lewis and Brønsted sites. The high yield of cumene conversion increased from Si/Al molar ratios of 50 to 10 and decreased for the Si/Al molar ratio of 7 due to the presence of pentahedral Al and/or inactive tetrahedral Al atoms in Pt/{HAlMSN}-7. The high selectivity of α-methylstyrene showed the important role of Lewis acid sites in these bifunctional catalysts. In spite of the coke formation in the Pt/{HAlMSN} catalysts, reactivation recovered the activity of the catalysts after 100 h of reaction. The molar absorption coefficients of Pt/{HAlMSN} were measured using pyridine followed by water adsorption monitored by {FTIR}.},

	abstract = {A new promising adsorbent, Ni supported on γ-Al2O3 was prepared in a simple electrolysis system (Ni/Al2O3-E) in minutes and was compared with the sample prepared by a physical mixing method (Ni/Al2O3-{PM}). The adsorbents were characterized by {XRD}, {TEM}, {FTIR}, 27Al {MAS} {NMR}, {XPS}, and {VSM}. The results showed that besides {NiO} nanoparticles, a {NiAl}2O4 spinel was also formed in Ni/Al2O3-E during the electrolysis via the dealumination and isomorphous substitution of Ni2+ ions. In contrast, only agglomerated {NiO} was found in the Ni/Al2O3-{PM}. Adsorption test on removal of Pd2+ ions from aqueous solution showed that the Pd2+ ions were exchanged with the hydrogen atoms of the surface–{OH} groups of both adsorbents. Significantly, the Ni/Al2O3-E demonstrated a higher adsorption towards Pd2+ ions than Ni/Al2O3-{PM} due to its remarkably higher degree of magnetism, which came from the {NiAl}2O4. The use of 0.1gL−1 Ni/Al2O3-E gave the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (qm) of 40.3mgg−1 at 303K and {pH} 5. The Ni/Al2O3-E showed high potential for simultaneous removal of various noble and transition metal ions and could be also used repetitively without affecting the high adsorptivity for Pd2+ ions. This work may provide promising adsorbents for recovery of various metals as well as other materials for such related applications.},

It is sourced from the musyarakah method in Islamic Syariah law and implemented for small-scale investments of traditional-market traders. They are the common target of usurers, so they may end up poorer than they were before. The main goal of the model is to find the appropriate portion of profit share, so the investment is profitable not only for the investor but also for the trader. There are three main problems in the process of formulating the mathematical model and finding optimized results. The first problem is providing the appropriate amount of data to be implemented in the model. The second problem is determining the objective function for the optimization of the portion of profit share. The last problem is determining the appropriate values of the parameters for certain types of traders. We found a significant result in determining the appropriate values of the parameters that explain the potential capability of the traders in handling larger amounts of capital to be invested in order to achieve our main goal.},

	abstract = {{ZnO}-incorporated mesostructured silica nanoparticles ({MSN}) catalysts ({ZM}) were prepared by the introduction of Zn ions into the framework of {MSN} via a simple electrochemical system in the presence of various concentrations of {NH}4OH aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were studied by {XRD}, 29Si {MAS} {NMR}, nitrogen adsorption–desorption, {FE}-{SEM}, {TEM}, {FTIR}, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Characterization results demonstrated that the alkaline aqueous electrolyte simply generated abundant silanol groups on the surface of the catalysts as a consequence of desilication to form the hierarchical-like structure of the {MSN}. Subsequent restructuring of the silica network by the creation of oxygen vacancies and formation of Si–O–Zn during the electrolysis, as well as formation of new Si–O–Si bonds during calcination seemed to be the main factors that enhanced the catalytic performance of photodecolorization of methyl orange. A {ZM} prepared in the presence of 1.0M {NH}4OH ({ZM}-1.0) was determined to be the most effective catalyst. The catalyst displays a higher first-order kinetics rate of 3.87×10−1h−1 than unsupported {ZnO} (1.13×10−1h−1) that prepared under the same conditions in the absence of {MSN}. The experiment on effect of scavengers showed that hydroxyl radicals generated from the three main sources; reduced O2 at the conduction band, decomposed water at the valence band and irradiated H2O2 in the solution, are key factors that influenced the reaction. It is also noted that the recycled {ZM}-1.0 catalyst maintained its activity up to five runs without serious catalyst deactivation.},

Our design is based on the presence of a moiety with a permanent dipole moment which can rotate, thereby modulating the couplings to metallic contacts at both ends of the molecule. Using the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green’s function formalism ({NEGF}), we show that our design indeed generates a pump current. In the non-interacting pump, the variation of frequency from adiabatic to non-adiabatic regime, can be used to control the direction as well as the amplitude of the average current. The effect of Coulomb interaction is considered within the first- and the second- order perturbation. The numerical implementation of the scheme is quite demanding, and we develop an analytical approximation to obtain a speed-up giving results within a reasonable time. We find that the amplitude of the average pumped current can be controlled by both the driving frequency and the Coulomb interaction. The direction of of pumped current is shown to be determined by the phase difference between left and right anchoring groups.},

Based on the experimental

Addition of the Pa-231 is expected to extend lifetime of the {BWR} core By optimizing the composition of the fuel elements (Th and Pa) at low moderation conditions (tight lattice) it can be obtained the reactor core which can be opeprated over 30 years without refueling or fuel shuffling. The Reactor core has a volume of 17,635.8 liter, power of 620 {MWt}, operating life of 30 and a maximum excess reactivity value of 0.384\% dk/k, could be achieved by using a composition of U-233 enrichment of 8.1 to 11\% and the addition of Pa-231 as much as 6.16 to 11.13\% with a power density of 35.2 watts/cc.},

Differential Scanning Calorimetry ({DSC}) analysis of the products shows a characteristic melting peak of the complexes at 140 °C. Compared to {PTHF}650, the {PTHF}1000 displays lower complexing ability with {PTHF}-b-amylose which is indicated by visible amylose retrogradation. The possible structures of the resulting products are estimated from Thermo Gravimetric Analysis ({TGA}) which reveals differences between {PTHF}-b-amylose and the corresponding complexes. In addition, X-Ray Diffraction ({XRD}) analysis demonstrates that the resulting structures of the complexes consist of 6-fold V-amylose helices. The results are confirmed further with Small Angle X-Ray Scattering ({SAXS}) diffractions which show that formation of inclusion complexes increases the crystalline size and regularity of the complex. There is a strong indication that the covalently attached {PTHF} block also induces the formation of V-amylose by residing in between the amylose blocks. In this case, the resulting structure of the complex is likely affected by both the complexation between amylose block and the added {PTHF} and by the in situ  self-assembly of the block copolymers.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fission has been modeled notoriously using two approaches method, macroscopic and microscopic. This work will propose another approach, where the nucleus is treated as a toy model. The aim is to see the usefulness of particle distribution in fission yield calculation. Inasmuch nucleus is a toy, then the Fission Toy Model ({FTM}) does not represent real process in nature completely. The fission event in {FTM} is represented by one random number. The number is assumed as width of distribution probability of nucleon position in compound nuclei when fission process is started. By adopting the nucleon density approximation, the Gaussian distribution is chosen as particle distribution. This distribution function generates random number that randomizes distance between particles and a central point. The scission process is started by smashing compound nucleus central point into two parts that are left central and right central points. The yield is determined from portion of nuclei distribution which is proportional with portion of mass numbers. By using modified {FTM}, characteristic of particle distribution in each fission event could be formed before fission process. These characteristics could be used to make prediction about real nucleons interaction in fission process.

The dispersion is well described by a conventional Heisenberg model suggesting a local moment model with nearest neighbor interaction of J=8 {meV}. Nearest and next-nearest neighbor interaction as well as interlayer coupling parameters are required to properly describe the entire dispersion. Spin-orbit coupling induces a very large anisotropy gap in the magnetic excitations in apparent contrast with a simple planar magnetic model. Orbital ordering breaking tetragonal symmetry, and strong spin-orbit coupling can thus be identified as important factors in this system.},

	abstract = {A numerical scheme based on the staggered finite volume method is presented at the aim of studying surface waves generated by a bottom motion. We address the 2D Euler equations in which the vertical domain is resolved only by one layer. The resulting non-hydrostatic scheme is used to simulate surface waves generated by bottom motion in a water tank. Here we mimic Hammack experiments numerically, in which a bed section is moved upwards or downwards, resulting in transient dispersive waves. For an impulsive downward bottom thrust, free surface responds in terms of a negative leading wave, followed with dispersive train of waves. For an upward bottom thrust, amplitude of the leading wave decays as the wave propagates, and no wave of permanent form evolves— instead, there appears a train of solitons. In this article, we show that our numerical scheme can produce the correct wave profiles, comparable with the analytical and experimental results of Hammack. Simulations using intermediate and slow bottom motions are also presented. In addition, we perform a simulation of a wave generated by submerged landslide, that compares well against previous numerical simulations. Via this simulation, we demonstrate that our scheme can incorporate a moving wet–dry boundary algorithm in the run-up simulation.},

The {XRD} data show that the resulted samples of Fe-free and Fe-doped compounds exhibit good 314 single phase quality with a tetragonal I4/mmm crystal structure. The measured M-T curves display the typical feature of ferromagnetic ({FM}) transition at 335 K for the Fe-free sample, while showing significantly degraded {FM} ordering for the 10 \% Fe-doped sample. The oxygen deficiency determined fro{\textbar}m our 10 \% Fe doped sample is found to decrease by only 0.025. Further detailed analysis of the {XRD} data also reveals distinctly different structural changes in the Co-O slabs compared to the 50 \% Fe-doped sample which exhibits a complete suppression of {FM} order. The results of this study, thus, have revealed the close relations among the changes induced by Fe doping in the magnetic ordering of crystal, and its oxygen content as well as the associated local structure in the Co-O layers responsible for the magnetic properties in the compound.},

The fabricated solar cells have typical configuration structure of {ITO}/{AZO}/P3HT:{PCBM}/{CuOx}/Ag. {AZO} and {CuOx} thin layers were prepared by the sol gel method, while P3HT:{PCBM} layer was prepared by the spin-coating method. The solar cell performances were found to be affected by the addition of {CuOx} interlayer. Solar cells with {CuOx} interlayer exhibit better working performance parameters (short-circuited photocurrent density, filling factor and power conversion efficiency) in comparison to solar cells without using {CuOx} interlayer. These improvements are attributed to more efficient charge extraction due to reduction of trapping or recombination loss, which is in agreement with the observed photocurrent transient characteristics.},

In this work, the fabricated {DSSC} do not exhibit significant degradation in its working performance.

To start with the investigation in modelling of this problem, we will assume that the ship is only a one-dimensional object that is floating on the sea surface. Similarly, we assume that the water flow is uniform in parallel directions to the ship. Therefore, we simply use the two-dimensional Laplace equation in this problem. In the section that describes the surface of sea, Neumann boundary condition is imposed in part related to the ship and the Dirichlet boundary condition for others. Then on the other three boundaries, we imposed the Neumann boundary condition by assuming that the water does not flow on the bottom, and both end. The model is solved by numerical solution using the finite element method. Velocity potential solution on the whole domain is demonstrated as a result of the implementation of the finite element method. In this paper, we initiate an investigation with assuming that the ship is on the water so that the domain of the Laplace equation is rectangular. Then we assume the drift ship. Furthermore, we also study the dependence of width and depth of the domain to the velocity potential.},

Here D and {rD} are the volume of deposit and its rate, L and {rL} are the volume of loan and its rate, and r is the interbank market rate. There are parameters required in this model which give connections between two variables or between two derivative functions. In this paper we simulate the model for several parameters values. We do bifurcation analysis on the dynamics of the system in order to identify the appropriate parameters that control the stability behaviour of the system. The result shows that the system will have a limit cycle for small value of interest rate of loan, so the deposit and loan volumes are fluctuating and oscillating extremely. If the interest rate of loan is too high, the loan volume will be decreasing and vanish and the system will converge to its carrying capacity.},

The {MC} code system (especially {DOSXYZnrc}) has been used to investigate the different voxel (volume elements) sizes effect on the accuracy of dose distributions. To investigate this effect on dosimetry parameters, calculations were made with three different voxel sizes. The effects were investigated with dose distribution calculations for seven voxel sizes: 1 × 1 × 0.1 cm3, 1 × 1 × 0.5 cm3, and 1 × 1 × 0.8 cm3. The 1 × 109 histories were simulated in order to get statistical uncertainties of 2\%. This simulation takes about 9-10 hours to complete. Measurements are made with field sizes 10 × 10 cm2 for the 6 {MV} photon beams with Gaussian intensity distribution {FWHM} 0.1 cm and {SSD} 100.1 cm. {MC} simulated and measured dose distributions in a water phantom. The output of this simulation i.e. the percent depth dose and dose profile in dmax from the three sets of calculations are presented and comparisons are made with the experiment data from {TTSH} (Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore) in 0-5 cm depth. Dose that scored in voxels is a volume averaged estimate of the dose at the center of a voxel. The results in this study show that the difference between Monte Carlo simulation and experiment data depend on the voxel size both for percent depth dose ({PDD}) and profile dose. {PDD} scan on Z axis (depth) of water phantom, the big difference obtain in the voxel size 1 × 1 × 0.8 cm3 about 17\%. In this study, the profile dose focused on high gradient dose area. Profile dose scan on Y axis and the big difference get in the voxel size 1 × 1 × 0.1 cm3 about 12\%.

	abstract = {New noise reduction method for reducing dose of {CT} scans has been proposed. The new method is expected to address the major problems in the noise reduction algorithm, i.e. the decreasing in the spatial resolution of the image. The proposed method was developed by combining adaptive Wiener filtering and edge detection algorithms. The first step, the image was filtered with a Wiener filter. Separately, edge detection operation performed on the original image using the Prewitt method. The next step, a new image was generated based on the edge detection operation. At the edge area, the image was taken from the original image, while at the non-edge area, the image was taken from the image that had been filtered with a Wiener filter. The new method was tested on a {CT} image of the spatial resolution phantom, which was scanned by different current-time multiplication, namely 80, 130 and 200 {mAs}, while other exposure factors were kept in constant conditions. The spatial resolution phantom consists of six sets of bar pattern made of plexi-glass and separated at some distance by water. The new image quality assessed from the amount of noise and the magnitude of spatial resolution. Noise was calculated by determining the standard deviation of the homogeneous regions, while the spatial resolution was assessed by observation of the area sets of the bar pattern. In addition, to evaluate the performance of this new method has also been tested on patient {CT} images. From the measurements, the new method can reduce the noise to an average 64.85\%, with a spatial resolution does not decrease significantly. Visually, the third set bar on the image phantom (the distance between the bar 1.0 mm) can still be distinguished, as well as on the original image. Meanwhile, if the image is only processed using Wiener filter, the second set bar (the distance between the bar 1.3 mm) are distinguishable. Testing this new method to patient image, its results in relatively the same. Thus, using this new method, it provides the potential for dose reduction more than 60\%.},

Unlike to the Coulomb’s force, the Newton‘s force is believed to be an approximated theory of gravity as it is unable to explain the Mercury’s orbit. This paper discusses the gravitational Bohr’s theory by taking into account the Newton’s potential and Weber’s potential; the later is a modified Newton’s gravitational potential that conforms, to some degrees, to the anomaly of the Mercury’s orbit.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo modelling of a linear accelerator is the first and most important step in Monte Carlo dose calculations in radiotherapy. Monte Carlo is considered today to be the most accurate and detailed calculation method in different fields of medical physics. In this research, we developed a photon beam model for Varian Clinac {iX} 6 {MV} equipped with {MilleniumMLC}120 for dose calculation purposes using {BEAMnrc}/{DOSXYZnrc} Monte Carlo system based on the underlying {EGSnrc} particle transport code. Monte Carlo simulation for this commissioning head {LINAC} divided in two stages are design head Linac model using {BEAMnrc}, characterize this model using {BEAMDP} and analyze the difference between simulation and measurement data using {DOSXYZnrc}. In the first step, to reduce simulation time, a virtual treatment head {LINAC} was built in two parts (patient-dependent component and patient-independent component). The incident electron energy varied 6.1 {MeV}, 6.2 {MeV} and 6.3 {MeV}, 6.4 {MeV}, and 6.6 {MeV} and the {FWHM} (full width at half maximum) of source is 1 mm. Phase-space file from the virtual model characterized using {BEAMDP}. The results of {MC} calculations using {DOSXYZnrc} in water phantom are percent depth doses ({PDDs}) and beam profiles at depths 10 cm were compared with measurements. This process has been completed if the dose difference of measured and calculated relative depth-dose data along the central-axis and dose profile at depths 10 cm is ≤ 5\%. The effect of beam width on percentage depth doses and beam profiles was studied. Results of the virtual model were in close agreement with measurements in incident energy electron 6.4 {MeV}. Our results showed that photon beam width could be tuned using large field beam profile at the depth of maximum dose. The Monte Carlo model developed in this study accurately represents the Varian Clinac {iX} with millennium {MLC} 120 leaf and can be used for reliable patient dose calculations. In this commissioning process, the good criteria of dose difference in {PDD} and dose profiles were achieve using incident electron energy 6.4 {MeV}.},

The results will be applicable for clinical Treatment Planning System.
Dose calculation has been implemented for water phantom and {CT} scan images of breast cancer using point source and line source. This study used point source and line source and divided into two cases. On the first case, Ir-192 seed source is located at the center of treatment volume. On the second case, the source position is gradually changed. The dose calculation of every case performed on a homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantom with dimension 20 × 20 × 20 cm3. The inhomogeneous phantom has inhomogeneities volume 2 × 2 × 2 cm3. The results of dose calculations using {PRISM} {TPS} were compared to literature data.
From the calculation of {PRISM} {TPS}, dose rates show good agreement with Plato {TPS} and other study as published by Ramdhani. No deviations greater than ±4\% for all case. Dose calculation in inhomogeneous and homogenous cases show similar result. This results indicate that Prism {TPS} is good in dose calculation of brachytherapy but not sensitive for inhomogeneities. Thus, the dose calculation parameters developed in this study were found to be applicable for clinical treatment planning of brachytherapy.},

The number of marbles represents the number of nucleons, A. This toy nucleus is able to imitate the real nucleus properties. In this research, the toy nucleons are only influenced by central force. A heavy toy nucleus induced by a toy nucleon will be split into two fragments. These two fission fragments are called fission yield. In this research, energy entanglement is neglected. Fission process in toy model is illustrated by two Gaussian curves intersecting each other. There are five Gaussian parameters used in this research. They are scission point of the two curves (Rc), mean of left curve (μL) and mean of right curve (μR), deviation of left curve (σL) and deviation of right curve (σR). The fission yields distribution is analyses based on Monte Carlo simulation. The result shows that variation in σ or µ can significanly move the average frequency of asymmetry fission yields. This also varies the range of fission yields distribution probability. In addition, variation in iteration coefficient only change the frequency of fission yields. Monte Carlo simulation for fission yield calculation using toy model successfully indicates the same tendency with experiment results, where average of light fission yield is in the range of 90{\textless}A{\textless}100 and average of heavy fission yield is in about 135{\textless}A{\textless}145.},

The scheme is started with the known absolute magnitudes and the known taxonomy classes of {NEAs}. Albedos are derived from the taxonomy classes, and eventually sizes can be determined. The sizes provide rotation periods and pole orientations using recent published results. Finally, by modeling some types of asteroid surfaces, the rest properties can be obtained. The scheme is used to provide the estimated physical properties of more than ten thousands {NEAs} representing their general picture needed for global dynamical study.},

	abstract = {This work aims to study the X-ray properties of the galactic black hole binary {GX} 339-4. Focus of the study is on exploration of data from Swift-{XRT} in exclusively photon-counting mode. We use data from 2007 up to August 2014, which contain about 40 pointing observations with level 1 data. The flux of {GX} 339-4 varies in a factor of 100 during this period of observations. For the purpose of this work, we also try to develop a system to conduct standard {SWIFT} {XRT} data reduction automatically, in order to greatly reduce time when working with data bulk, which produces images, lightcurves as well as spectra. We also develop another system to conduct fitting of bulk spectral data with a two-component model, disk blackbody and power-law. The fitting results show that no data have a reduced chi-squared {\textgreater} 2. The fraction of the disk to total flux and the power-law to total flux range from 0.00389 – 0.994 and 0.00605 – 0.996, respectively. From the analysis of the disk component, we obtain the value of the innermost disk radius that does not show any large scale truncation which is in a good agreement with a previous study that used 2007 – 2011 Swift-{XRT} data, indicating that the systems we developed work properly.},

Due to this condition, detail events in the Sun can possibly observable. For example, flare, prominence, granulation and other features can be seen easily compared to other stars. In other word the observational data can be obtained easily. And for better understanding, computational simulation is needed too. In this paper we use {ZEUS}-{MP}, a numerical code for the simulation of fluid dynamical flows in astrophysics, to study granulation and blast wave in the Sun. {ZEUS}-{MP} allows users to use hydrodynamic ({HD}) or magneto hydrodynamic ({MHD}) simulations singly or in concert, in one, two, or three space dimensions. For granulation case, we assume that there is no influence from magnetic field. So, it’s enough to just use {HD} simulations. Physical parameters were analyzed for this case is velocity and density. The result shows that velocity as time function indicated more complex pattern than density. For blast wave case, we use it to study one of the Sun energetic event namely Coronal Mass Ejections ({CMEs}). In this case, we cannot ignore influence from magnetic field. So we use {MHD} simulations. Physical parameters were analyzed for this case is velocity and energy. The result shows more complex pattern for both parameters. It is shown too as if they have opposite pattern. When energy is high, velocity is not too fast, conversely.},

The location of L4 is analytically derived then the stability of L4 and its zero velocity curves are studied numerically.

One way to obtain such 3D descriptions is to record a large set of individual absorption or reddening measurements toward target stars located at various known distances and directions. The inversion of these measurements using a tomographic method can produce spatial distribution of the {ISM}. Until recently absorption data were very limited and distances to the target stars are still uncertain, but the situation will greatly improve thanks to current and future massive stellar surveys from ground, and to Gaia mission. To prepare absorption data for inversion from a huge number of stellar spectra, automated tools are needed. We have developed various spectral analysis tools adapted to different type of spectra, early- or late- type star. We also have used diffuse interstellar bands ({DIBs}) to trace {IS} structures and kinematics. Although we do not know yet their carriers, they can be a promising tool to trace distant interstellar clouds or Galactic arms. We present some examples of the interstellar fitting and show the potentiality of {DIBs} in tracing the {ISM}. We will also briefly show and comment the latest 3D map of the local {ISM} which reveal nearby cloud complexes and cavities.},

	abstract = {Extraordinary mudflow has happened in Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia since 2006. This mud comes from the giant crater that is located close to the {BJP} - 01. Thousands of homes have been submerged due to mudflow. Till today this giant mud crater is still has great strength despite the mud flowing over 8 years. This is a very rare phenomenon in the world. This mud flow mechanism raises big questions, because it has been going on for years, naturally the mudflow will stop by itself because the pressure should be reduced. This research evaluates all aspects of integrated observations, laboratory tests and field observations since the beginning of this ongoing mudflow. Laboratory tests were done by providing hot air bubbles into the fluid inside the inverted funnel showed that the fluid can flow with a high altitude. It is due to the mechanism of buoyant force from air bubbles to the water where the contrast density of the water and the air is quite large. Quantity of air bubbles provides direct effect to the debit of fluid flow. Direct observation in the field, in 2006 and 2007, with {TIMNAS} and {LPPM} {ITB} showed the large number of air bubbles on the surface of the mud craters. Temperature observation on the surface of mud crater is around 98 degree C whereas at greater depth shows the temperature is increasingly rising. This strengthens the hypothesis or proves that the mud pumping mechanism comes from buoyant force of hot air bubbles. Inversion gravity images show that the deep subsurface of main crater is close to volcanic layers or root of Arjuna mountain. Based on the simulation laboratory and field observation data, it can be concluded that the geothermal factor plays a key role in the mudflow mechanism.},

The porosity and the grain radius of the models were made to match the real sample, which is a sandstone obtained from Ngrayong formation. The models were produced using an algorithm to ensure the grains were consolidated. The three models have different grain shapes, which are spherical, ellipsoidal and non-spherical (polygonal). Digital image analysis were performed to the three models in order to characterize the features of the models. The porosity is set on the value ∼21\%. Despite the fact that the porosity and grain size (as well as the distribution) of the models are set to have very similar value, the produced models reveal different pore structure features. From the 2D and 3D fractal dimensions, the ellipsoidal model has the highest value among other models (the spherical and polygonal have very similar value) which indicates that the ellipsoidal model has more complex pore structure. This is confirmed by the degree of anisotropy ({DA}), where the ellipsoidal model has {DA} of 2.66 while the spherical is of 1.10 and the polygonal is of 1.46. The average of the structure separation of the models, which basically a rough estimate of the pore size reveals that the ellipsoidal model has narrower pore size compared two other models, which have very similar result. The average structure thickness of the models, which basically a rough estimate of the grain size shows that the ellipsoidal model has smallest value compared to the other two models, which once again, have very similar result. Here we conclude that the ellipsoidal model has the most complex and anisotropic pore structure compared to the two other models. Future work are focused on analyzing the effect of the grain size to other physical properties such as permeability, tortuosity and the elastic properties.},

Physical based approach to measure porosity such as mercury porosimetry injection is unable to locate closed pore inside porous rock even though it is still possible to quantify the closed porosity. Digital data of porous rock in the form of three dimensional image can now be obtained by means of several methods such as micro-{CT} scan. Using the digital data, closed pore can be identified and isolated using digital rock physics approach. We first construct a synthetic three dimensional porous sample which consist of two simple side-to-side connected pore (cylinder and box shaped) and two spherical isolated pore which has closed porosity of 1.41 \%. The digital image analysis which implemented in software {CTAn} (Bruker Micro-{CT}) still produce error of 0.04\% which is very low. However, analysis using Lattice Boltzmann Method based simulation of fluid flow provide exact match to the closed porosity of the synthetic sample. Nevertheless, there are two disadvantages of this method, i.e., the simulation could take hours compared to the digital image analysis which only took several minutes and the limitation of numerical definition of zero velocity. Thus we apply both methods in order to overcome the drawbacks of each methods to analyze the digital sample of Fontainebleau sandstone. Using {CTAn}, we obtained the closed porosity of 0.02891845 \% and using the {LBM} based fluid flow simulation of 0.028948346 \%. The closed pore can then be isolated to further calculate the surface area. The result also confirmed that pore space of Fontainebleau sandstone is well connected.},

	abstract = {As a smaller grain, which is attached on larger one, is growing, it pushes also the larger one and other grains in its surrounding. In a simulation of similar system, repulsive force such as contact force based on linear spring-dashpot model can not accommodate this situation when cell growing rate is faster than simulation time step, since it produces sudden large overlap between grains that makes unphysical result. An algorithm that preserves system linear momentum by introducing additional velocity induced by cell growth is presented in this work. It should be performed in an implicit step. The algorithm has successfully eliminated unphysical overlap.},

In this study, we obtained numerical solution of three-dimensional (3-D) {MT} using vector finite element method by solving second order Maxwell differential equation describing diffusion of plane wave through the conductive earth. Rather than the nodes of the element, the edges of the element is used as a vector basis to overcome the occurrence of nonphysical solutions that usually faced by scalar (node based) finite element method. Electric vector fields formulation was used and the resulting system of equation was solved using direct solution method to obtain the electric vector field distribution throughout the earth resistivity model structure. The resulting {MT} response functions was verified with 1-D layered Earth and 3-D2 {COMMEMI} outcropping structure. Good agreement is achieved for both structure models.},

Simulation result shows that Young modulus of the composite increases linearly with the increase of friction coefficient between matrix and fiber. This shows that if the value of Young's modulus of the fiber is far greater than the Young's modulus of the matrix, then the value of Young's modulus of the resulting composite will tend to get closer to the value of Young's modulus of the fiber.

To determine the effect of cobalt stearate in {HDPE}, oxo-biodegradable polyethylene film was given an irradiation with {UV} light or heating at various temperature. After given a heating, the {FTIR} spectra showed a new absorption peak at wave number 1712 cm−1 indicating the presence of carbonyl groups in polymers, whereas after irradiation with {UV} light is not visible the presence of this absorption peak. The increase concentration of cobalt stearate added in {HDPE} and the higher heating temperature, the intensity of the absorption peak of the carbonyl group increased. The increasing intensity of the carbonyl group absorption is caused the presence of damage in the film surface after heating, and this result is supported by analysis the surface properties of the film with using {SEM}. Biodegradation tests were performed on oxo-biodegradable polyethylene film which has been given heating or {UV} light with using activated sludge under optimal conditions the growth of microorganisms. After biodegradation, the maximum weight decreased by 23\% in the oxo-biodegradable polyethylene film with a cobalt stearate concentration of 0.2\% and after heating at a temperature of 75 °C for 10 days, and only 0.69\% in the same film after irradiation {UV} light for 10 days.

This optical response shows the unique feature of significantly high density fringe especially below the band gap energy region (lower than 3.3 {eV}) in contrast to the conventional {TiO}2 thin film structure. This unique feature is interpreted as a dominant contribution of the vertical interfaces at columnar boundaries towards reflected light from the sample.

Furthermore, by comparing the {SE} data from different measurement orientations, it has been shown that {TiO}2:Co tends to be anisotropic.

Experimental results showed that neutral-alumina was a better solid support than basic-alumina. The optimum temperature for the reaction was approximately at 125-133 °C with reaction time of 15 minutes and microwave reactor power at 500-600 W.

Fraction {II} also contained three compounds, which were tetracarbazole C, tetraphenylhydrazine, and plasticizer such as bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.

	abstract = {The development of fusion energy is one of the important International energy strategies with the important milestone is {ITER} (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project, initiated by many countries, such as: America, Europe, and Japan who agreed to set up {TOKAMAK} type fusion reactor in France. In ideal fusion reactor the fuel is purely deuterium, but it need higher temperature of reactor. In {ITER} project the fuels are deuterium and tritium which need lower temperature of the reactor. In this study tritium for fusion reactor can be produced by using reaction of lithium with neutron in the blanket region. With the tritium breeding blanket which react between Li-6 in the blanket with neutron resulted from the plasma region. In this research the material used in each layer surrounding the plasma in the reactor is optimized. Moreover, achieving self-sufficiency condition in the reactor in order tritium has enough availability to be consumed for a long time. In order to optimize Tritium Breeding Ratio ({TBR}) value in the fusion reactor, there are several strategies considered here. The first requirement is making variation in Li-6 enrichment to be 60\%, 70\%, and 90\%. But, the result of that condition can not reach {TBR} value better than with no enrichment. Because there is reduction of Li-7 percent when increasing Li-6 percent. The other way is converting neutron multiplier material with Pb. From this, we get {TBR} value better with the Be as neutron multiplier. Beside of {TBR} value, fusion reactor can analyze the distribution of neutron flux and dose rate of neutron to know the change of neutron concentration for each layer in reactor. From the simulation in this study, 97\% neutron concentration can be absorbed by material in reactor, so it is good enough. In addition, it is required to analyze spectrum neutron energy in many layers in the fusion reactor such as in blanket, coolant, and divertor. Actually material in that layer can resist in high temperature and high pressure condition for more than ten years.},

	abstract = {An oxidant additive is one type of additive used for oxo-biodegradable polymers. This additive was prepared by reaction multivalent transition metals and fatty acids to accelerate the degradation process of polymers by providing a thermal treatment or irradiation with light. This study focused on the synthesis of manganese stearate as an additive for application in High Density Polyethylene ({HDPE}), and the influence of manganese stearate on the characteristics of {HDPE} including their biodegradability. Manganese stearate was synthesized by the reaction of stearic acid with sodium hydroxide, and sodium stearate formed was reacted with manganese chloride tetrahydrate to form manganese stearate with a melting point of 100-110 °C. Based on the {FTIR} spectrum showed absorption peak at wave number around 1560 cm−1 which is an asymmetric vibration of {CO} functional group that binds to the manganese. The films of oxo-biodegradable polymer were prepared by blending {HDPE} and manganese stearate additives at various concentrations with using the polymer melting method, followed heating at a temperature of 50°C and 70°C for 10 days. The characterizations of the oxo-biodegradable polymers were carried out by analysis the functional groups ({FTIR} and {ATR}),thermal properties ({TGA}), surface properties ({SEM}), as well as analysis of the biodegradability (the biodegradation test by using activated sludge, \% weight loss). Based on {COi} indicate that the additive of manganese stearate is active in oxidizing polymer by heating treatment. Results of biodegradation by microorganisms from activated sludge showed that the percentage weight loss of polymers increase with the increasing incubation time and the concentration of manganese stearate in {HDPE}. Biodegradability of {HDPE} with the addition of manganese stearate and followed by heating at a higher temperature was better observed. The highest percentage weight loss was obtained at the polymer with concentration of 0.2\% manganese stearate, and followed by thermal treatment at a temperature of 70 °C and the incubation time for 45 days in the activated sludge.},

As 100 percent concentration of H applied on top and bottom layer of germanene, the band gap is 1.41 {eV}. The pairing of the pz-orbital of Ge with the s-orbital of H gave contribution to the band gap of hydrogenated germanene. External electrical field is also can be applied to open the band gap.

Besides its length, sucker rod string also classified into tapered and un-tapered. At the beginning of this research, for easy modeling, the sucker rod string was assumed as un-tapered. The assumption proved non-realistic to use. Therefore, the tapered sucker rod string modeling needs building. The numerical solution of this sucker rod beam pump model is computed using finite difference method. The numerical result shows that the peak of polished rod load for sucker rod beam pump unit C-456-D-256-120, for non-tapered sucker rod string is 38504.2 lb, while for tapered rod string is 25723.3 lb.

We also introduce the threshold value using winner-take-all approach to obtain scale-free property of the network. This means that the nodes of the network that has a cross correlation coefficient below the threshold value should not be connected with an edge. As a result, we obtain 0.5 as the threshold value for all of the stock market.

One of the strategy is by using metagenomic approach to amplify the gene directly from environmental sample. This research was focused on amplification of lipase gene fragment directly from the thermogenic phase of domestic waste composting in aerated trenches. We used domestic waste compost from waste treatment at {SABUGA}, {ITB} for the sample. Total chromosomal {DNA} were directly extracted from several stages at thermogenic phase of compost.

The results showed that the primers amplified the gene from four stages of thermogenic phase with the size of lipase gene fragment of approximately 570 base pairs (bp).

Simulation results show that the normal regulation of blood glucose concentration depends on insulin and glucagon concentrations. On type 1 diabetic case, the role of insulin on regulating blood glucose is not optimal because of the destruction of β cells in pancreas. These β cells destructions cause hyperglycemic episode affecting the whole body metabolism. To get over this, type 1 diabetic patients need insulin therapy to control the blood glucose level. This research has been done by using rapid acting insulin (lispro), long-acting insulin (glargine) and the combination between them to know the effects of insulin therapy on blood glucose, insulin and glucagon concentrations. Simulation results show that these different types of insulin have different effects on blood glucose concentration. Insulin therapy using lispro shows better blood glucose control after consumption of meals. Glargin gives better blood glucose control between meals and during sleep.

	abstract = {Electroporation is formation of the pores in the membran cell due to external electric field applied to the cell. There are two types of electroporation, conventional and supra-electroporation. Both of them have a different characteristic of electric field used. Thus, the purpose of this research is to study the influence of the intenisty of electric field, pulse width, and pulse rise time given to the cell model and then compare the result of pores density formed. For both types, the electric field intensity ranged from 0.05 {kV}/cm – 100 {kV}/cm. For conventional electroporation, the pulse width and the rise time are constant at 1 {kV}/cm and 2 microseconds. For supra-electroporation, the pulse width and the rise time are constant at 60 {kV}/cm and 2 nanoseconds. As for variation in rise time, electric field intensity, and pulse width will be constant at 1 {kV}/cm and 60 microseconds for conventional electroporation and 60 {kV}/cm and 60 nanoseconds for supra-electroporation. The results showed that electric field intensity and rise time gave significant effects in transmembrane voltage and pores density. It can be concluded that the intensity of the electric field and the rise time greatly affect the electroporation phenomenon, although pulse width did not have any effect in transmembrane voltage and pore density.},

Pa-231 known as actinide material, have large capture cross section and can be converted into fissile material that can be utilized to reduce excess reactivity. Americium is one of minor actinides with long half life. The objective of adding americium is to decrease nuclear spent fuel in the world. The neutronic analysis results show that mixed nitride fuel have k-inf greater than uranium nitride fuel. It is caused by the addition of Pu-239 in mixed nitride fuel. In fuel fraction analysis, for uranium nitride fuel, the optimum volume fractions are 45\% fuel fraction, 10\% cladding and 45\% moderator. In case of {UN}-{PuN} fuel, the optimum volume fractions are 30\% fuel fraction, 10\% cladding and 60\% coolant/ moderator. The addition of Pa-231 as burnable poison for {UN} fuel, enrichment U-235 5\%, with Pa-231 1.6\% has k-inf more than one and excess reactivity of 14.45\%. And for mixed nitride fuel, the lowest value of reactivity swing is when enrichment (U-235+Pu) 8\% with Pa-231 0.4\%, the excess reactivity value 13,76\%. The fuel pin analyze for the addition of Americium, the excess reactivity value is lower than before, because Americium absorb the neutron. For {UN} fuel, enrichment U-235 8\%, Pa-231 1.6\% and Am 0.5\%, the excess reactivity is 4.86\%. And for mixed nitride fuel, when enrichment (U-235+Pu) 13\%, Pa-231 0.4\% and Am 0.1\%, the excess reactivity is 11.94\%.

The aluminas applied as support were alumina synthesized through hydrothermal process, alumina formed by pretreatment of catapal and commercial alumina which named as Ahy, Aca, and Aco respectively. Ahy has uniform morphology of nanotubes while Aca and Aco showed non-uniform morphology of particle lumps. The particle lumps of Aca were larger than those of Aco. Ahy, Aca, and Aco respectively has average pore diameter of 2.75, 2.86 and 2.9 nm. Metals were deposited on the supports by incipient-wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by {XRD}, H2-{TPR}, and H2 chemisorption. Catalyst acitivity test for Fischer-Tropsch reaction was carried out in a micro reactor at 200 °C and 1 atm, and molar ratio of H2/{CO} = 2:1. The metal oxide particle size increased in the order M/Aco {\textless} M/Aca {\textless} M/Ahy. The catalysts reducibility also increased according to the order M/Aco {\textless} M/Aca {\textless} M/Ahy suggesting that the larger metal oxide particles are more reducible. The number of active site was not proportional to the reducibility because during the reduction, larger metal oxide particles were converted into larger metal particles. On the other hand, the number of active sites was inversely proportional to the particle sizes. The number of active site increased in the order M/Ahy {\textless} M/Aco {\textless} M/Aca. The catalytic activity also increased in the following order M/Ahy {\textless} M/Aco {\textless} M/Aca. The activity per active site increased according to the order M/Aca {\textless} M/Aco {\textless} M/Ahy meaning that for M/Ahy, a little increase in active site will lead to a significance increase in catalytic activity. It showed that Ahy has potential for the better support.},

	abstract = {Accurate modeling and estimation of impedance functions is essential for the correct interpretation of Controlled Source Audio Magnetotelluric ({CSAMT}) measurements. Non plane wave effect of {CSAMT} source and noises are inevitably encountered when {CSAMT} observations are conducted and, consequently, impedance estimates are usually based on least-squares ({LS}) approximation, and the resulting estimates need to be corrected for the non plane wave field fraction. However, estimation procedure based on {LS} would not be statistically optimal, as outliers (abnormal data) are frequently superimposed on a normal ambient {CSAMT} noise field. In this situation, the estimation can be seriously misleading, while plane wave correction has also limited application, as the non plane wave field fraction is reasonably strong. This paper briefly discus the recent development of alternative methods for the {CSAMT} impedance modeling and its estimation, those are efficient in nature. The means for accomplishing the non plane wave problem is based on full solution numerical modeling of {CSAMT} impedance function that accommodates the non plane wave effect in the function. Whilst, one appealing approach to dealing with outliers is to make the estimation procedure robust. This is based on the M-estimation and the Hilbert transform operating on the causal {CSAMT} impedance functions. As demonstrated, the full solution based modeling for {CSAMT} impedance function is applied for all measurement zones, including near-, transition- as well as the far-field zones, and suitably, the plane wave correction is no longer needed for the impedance function. In the resulting impedance estimates, outlier contamination is removed and the self consistency between the real and imaginary parts of the impedance estimates is guaranteed. Using synthetic data, it is shown that the proposed methods can produce usable {CSAMT} impedance functions for all measurement zones, even under condition of severe noise contamination.},

From {SEM} characterization results it can be concluded that the carbon layer on {HF} treated substrate is more uniform than on substrate without treated. Carbon deposition rate is higher as confirmed by {AFM} results if the silicon substrate is treated by {HF} solution. {EDAX} characterization results tell that silicon (111) substrate with {HF} treatment have more carbon fraction than substrate without treatment.

Afterward, the carbon atomic arrangement on silicon (111) surface is studied by performing thermal annealing process to 900 °C. From Raman spectroscopy results, thin film carbon is not changing until 600 °C thermal budged. But, when temperature increase to 900 °C, thin film carbon is starting to diffuse to silicon (111) substrates.},

	abstract = {A citric acid was used as a carbon source in the preparation of boron carbon oxy-nitride ({BCNO}) phosphor particles by a facile process. The preparation process was conducted at relatively low temperature 750 °C and at ambient pressure. The prepared {BCNO} phosphors showed a high photoluminescence ({PL}) performance at peak emission wavelength of 470 nm under excitation by a {UV} light 365 nm. The effects of carbon/boron and nitrogen/boron molar ratios on the {PL} properties were also investigated. The result showed that the emission spectra with a wavelength peak ranging from 444 nm to 496 nm can be obtained by varying carbon/boron ratios from 0.1 to 0.9. In addition, the observations showed that the {BCNO} phosphor material has two excitation peaks located at the 365 nm ({UV}) and 420 nm (blue). Based on these observations, we believe that the citric acid derived {BCNO} phosphor particles can be a promising inexpensive material for phosphor conversion-based white {LED}.},

The samples were prepared using {NiCl}2·6H2O as precursor, {EG} as solvent and agglomeration preventing agent, and ammonium bicarbonate as precipitant. In this research, the effect of calcination temperature and precursor concentration were investigated. The experimental result showed that crystallite sizes of {NiO} were 4.8 nm, 9.1 nm, and 15.3 nm when the calcinations temperature was 300°C, 400°C, and 500°C respectively. It was obvious that when calcinations temperature increased, the crystallite size of {NiO} increased, then the calculated activation energy for {NiO} nanocrystalline growth during calcinations is 21.33 {kJmol}−1.In the effect of precursor concentration,by using concentrations 0.25 M, 0.5 M, and 1 M, crystallite sizes increase with the increasing concentration as 17.4 nm, 15.7 nm, and 24.8 nm respectively.

The main problem of using {HfSiOxN} is the charge trapping formed at the {HfSiOxN}/{SiO}2 interface that can influence the performance of the device.

After rotating one rotation, the sensor sends one pulse and the number of pulses are counted for a certain time of counting.

To satisfy a high power and high voltage in the equipment, we used the full-bridge configuration switching. It works on 990 Hz maximum frequency, and can deliver maximum current of 1.9 A at 620 V. The switching is controlled by microcontroller using Pulse Width Modulation ({PWM}) and the driver of inverter is built using {IGBT}. The output frequency can be varied from 1 Hz to 990 Hz. For varied frequencies the harmonic distortion is different due to switching speed. As frequency increase the harmonic distortion also increase. We found that the total harmonic distortion can be reduced to 1 \% at the output with 330 Hz.},

In the {TIR} method, the light coming toward the prism will experience reflection and out of the prism at a certain angle direction. Results of analysis of the geometry and Snell’s law shows that the angular position of the detector is not only determined by the angle of incidence of light alone but also by the size of the prism and the detector position from the rotation axis of goniometer. The experimental results show relation between the angle of detector and angle of goniometer. When the prism rotated 45 °, position of goniometer detector is 2×45 °. However, when the prism rotated at an angle instead of 45 °, detector position µ is not always equal to twice the rotation angle goniometer ψ, so that this relationship needs to be corrected. This correction is also determined by the value of the refractive index of the prism is used. By knowing the relationship between detector position and the incident angle of light, this formulation can be used to control the position of the sample and the detector in the experiments based on {ATR}.},

In this paper, we particularly study a static spherical symmetric black holes. In the asymptotic region the complex scalars are frozen which can be viewed as the critical points of the black hole and the scalar potentials with vanishing scalar charges. then, it turns out that the asymptotic geometries have a constant scalar curvature which in general are not Einstein. These spaces are boundaries of the black holes which could also correspond to the near horizon geometries if the value of the scalars in both regions coincides.},

	abstract = {Thorium has lately attracted considerable attention because it is accumulating as a by-product of large scale rare earth mining. The objective of research is to analyze transient behavior of a heavy water cooled thorium breeder that is designed by Tokai University and Tokyo Institute of Technology. That is oxide fueled, {PWR} type reactor with heavy water as primary coolant. An example of the optimized core has relatively small moderator to fuel volume ratio ({MFR}) of 0.6 and the characteristics of the core are burn-up of 67 {GWd}/t, breeding ratio of 1.08, burn-up reactivity loss during cycles of {\textless} 0.2\% dk/k, and negative coolant reactivity coefficient. One of the nuclear reactor accidents types examined here is Unprotected Transient over Power ({UTOP}) due to withdrawing of the control rod that result in the positive reactivity insertion so that the reactor power will increase rapidly. Another accident type is Unprotected Loss of Flow ({ULOF}) that caused by failure of coolant pumps. To analyze the reactor accidents, neutron distribution calculation in the nuclear reactor is the most important factor. The best expression for the neutron distribution is the Boltzmann transport equation. However, solving this equation is very difficult so that the space-time diffusion equation is commonly used. Usually, space-time diffusion equation is solved by employing a point kinetics approach. However, this approach is less accurate for a spatially heterogeneous nuclear reactor and the nuclear reactor with quite large reactivity input. Direct method is therefore used to solve space-time diffusion equation which consider spatial factor in detail during nuclear reactor accident simulation. Set of equations that obtained from full implicit finite-difference method is solved by using iterative methods. The indication of {UTOP} accident is decreasing macroscopic absorption cross-section that results large external reactivity, and {ULOF} accident is indicated by decreasing coolant flow. The power reactor has a peak value before reactor has new balance condition. The analysis showed that temperatures of fuel and claddings during accident are still below limitations which are in secure condition.},

Geometrically, the silicon atom creates sp3 bond with three adjacent carbon atoms, where the tetrahedral form of its sp3 bond is consisted of free unoccupied state.

	abstract = {The existence of horizontal strata in sandstone has been identified by geologists. The thin layers are important in the way they affect some of the processes used to recover petroleum from the sandstone reservoir. In this research, we developed laboratory scale of laminated rock models as well as the computer models. The laboratory scale models were generated using sand with different grain size that was arranged into three layers. The computer models were generated using non-spherical grain model. The effects of variation of the laminae’s grain size and thickness were analyzed to identify the most significant feature of the layer. Flow properties of the laboratory scale models were conducted experimentally using falling-head method, while for the computer models; the permeability was calculated using Lattice Boltzmann Method. The result shows that the hydraulic conductivity of the laboratory scale models decreases as the thickness ratio of the laminae increases. For the computer models, the permeability decreases as the thickness ratio of the laminae increases. The variation of laminae’s grain size also influences the flow properties of the models, i.e. the hydraulic conductivity and the permeability are increasing as the grain size of the laminae increases.},

Orbital coupling between distributions of semi major axis (a) and inclination (i) segregated at about 2 {AU} turns out to exhibit bump at about inclination of about 20°. This bump is emerged because of the diversity in orbital mobility of {NEAs} between regions of a {\textless} 2 {AU} and a {\textgreater} 2 {AU}, in which correspond to the secular and the mean-motion resonances. {NEAs} which located at a {\textgreater} 2 {AU} are dominated by the asteroids whose i {\textless} 15° and are protected by the secular resonance (υ6) of Saturn. In addition, thermal effect play a role in delivering {NEAs} through perihelia of the Terrestrial planets, mainly affect orbital diffusion of {NEAs} when passing through the υ6 region, and somehow restrain {NEAs} from falling into the Sun.},

Generally, phenomenon of amplitude in various angles assumes reservoir’s layer is quite thick. It also means that the wave is assumed as a very high frequency. But, in natural condition, the seismic wave is band limited and has quite low frequency. Therefore, topic about amplitude various angles in thin layer reservoir as well as low frequency assumption is important to be considered. Thin layer reservoir means the thickness of reservoir is about or less than quarter of wavelength. In this paper, I studied about the reflection phenomena in elastic wave which considering interference from thin layer reservoir and transmission wave. I applied Zoeppritz equation for modeling reflected wave of top reservoir, reflected wave of bottom reservoir, and also transmission elastic wave of reservoir. Results show that the phenomena of {AVA} in thin layer reservoir are frequency dependent. Thin layer reservoir causes interference between reflected wave of top reservoir and reflected wave of bottom reservoir. These phenomena are frequently neglected, however, in real practices. Even though, the impact of inattention in interference phenomena caused by thin layer in {AVA} may cause inaccurate reservoir characterization. The relation between classes of {AVA} reservoir and reservoir’s character are different when effect of ones in thin reservoir and ones in thick reservoir are compared. In this paper, I present some {AVA} phenomena including its cross plot in various thin reservoir types based on some rock physics data of Indonesia.},

In this study, we have measured the changes of magnetic viscosity over the time delay and magnetic susceptibility in a suite of natural samples. The results show that viscous magnetization decays with time (in logarithmic scale or log t) which follows the trend of cubical-logarithmic decay. This is a unique response of fine magnetic grains, i.e. superparamagnetic grains, when that magnetization was measured in very short time delay. We then found the correlation between parameters of magnetic viscosity, S in specific range of time delay, and parameters derived from magnetic susceptibility measurements. This correlation enables the measurements of magnetic viscosity to be used in order to approximate fraction of specific size of fine magnetic grains in bulk samples.},

Polymer electrolyte membrane was prepared by mixing poly(vinyl alcohol) ({PVA}), poly(ethylene oxide) ({PEO}), and {LiClO}4 with various compositions, and each component of was separately dissolved in demineralized water. Polymer solution was stirred until homogeneous, the solution was then poured onto a petri dish, and the solvent was evaporated to form the film/membrane.

The optimal ionic conductivity was obtained on the membrane with {PVA}/{PEO} composition of 7/3 (w/w). By addition of {PEO} on the blending of {LiClO}4-{PVA} can increase the mechanical stress and modulus at break of the membranes, and the optimal mechanical stress and modulus at break of membranes were obtained in the membrane with {PVA}/{PEO} ratio of 8/2. In addition, the increase {LiClO}4 content in membranes can improve the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte membranes, but the mechanical strength of membranes decreases.},

The crystallinity of {CNC} determined by {FTIR} was found to be higher than {BC}. By {TEM} observation, the {CNC} particles had average length of 325nm and diameter of 25nm with average aspect ratio (L/D) around 13. The {TEM} images also show the morphology of {CNC} that has rod-like structure.},

	abstract = {Vector-borne diseases are commonly known in tropical and subtropical countries. These diseases have contributed to more than 10\% of world infectious disease cases. Among the vectors responsible for transmitting the diseases are mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, flies, bugs and worms. Several of the diseases are known to contribute to the increasing threat to human health such as malaria, dengue, filariasis, chikungunya, west nile fever, yellow fever, encephalistis, and anthrax. It is necessary to understand the real process of infection, factors which contribute to the complication of the transmission in order to come up with a good and sound mathematical model. Although it is not easy to simulate the real transmission process of the infection, we could say that almost all models have been developed from the already long known Host-Vector model. It constitutes the main transmission processes i.e. birth, death, infection and recovery. From this simple model, the basic concepts of Disease Free and Endemic Equilibria and Basic Reproductive Ratio can be well explained and understood. Theoretical, modeling, control and treatment aspects of disease transmission problems have then been developed for various related diseases. General construction as well as specific forms of basic reproductive ratios for vector-borne diseases are discusses here.},

Regulation is held via modification the cellular activities of a metabolic system. In this study, we present a metabolic analysis of ethanol fermentation process of a yeast cell in terms of continuous culture scheme. The metabolic regulation is based on the kinetic formulation in combination with metabolic control analysis to indicate the key enzymes which can be modified to enhance ethanol production. The model is used to calculate the intracellular fluxes in the central metabolism of the yeast cell. Optimal control is then applied to the kinetic model to find the optimal regulation for the fermentation system. The sensitivity results show that there are external and internal control parameters which are adjusted in enhancing ethanol production. As an external control parameter, glucose supply should be chosen in appropriate way such that the optimal ethanol production can be achieved. For the internal control parameter, we find three enzymes as regulation targets namely acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase, and alcohol dehydrogenase which reside in the acetaldehyde branch. Among the three enzymes, however, only acetaldehyde dehydrogenase has a significant effect to obtain optimal ethanol production efficiently.},

In the model, we assume that the treatments have direct killing effect to microfilariae, increase of immune-mediated effect. The treated individuals are assumed to remain susceptible to the disease. This is due to the fact that the treatment is only partially effective against macrofilaria. Simulations of the model reveals that {DEC}-{ALB} treatment does give significant reduction of acute and chronic compartments at the end of the treatment period and slow down the growth after the treatment before eventually tend to the endemic state. It showed that repeated treatment during {MDA} is effective to decrease the transmission.

Here we construct a delay differential equation model for dengue transmission in a closed population where regular visits of people to a mosquito breeding site out of their residency such as traditional market take place daily. Basic reproductive ratio of the system is obtained and depends on the ratio between the outgoing rates of susceptible human and infective human.

Due to this property, it is more easily to be modified for various applications such as for reinforcing agent in lithium ion battery separator. Nanocrystalline cellulose was obtained by acid hydrolysis of cellulose. The cellulose used in this study was obtained by isolation of corncob, followed by hydrolyzed using H2SO4 50\% at 45°C for 60 minutes. Nanocrystalline cellulose was then characterized by {FT}-{IR} spectroscopy, Particle Size Analyzer ({PSA}), Scanning Electron Microscope ({SEM}) and X-Ray diffraction. Based on {PSA} results, the nanocrystalline cellulose has an average diameter of 17,4 nm with a spherical morphology determined by {SEM} analysis. The analysis of X-Ray diffraction showed the crystallinity index of nanocrystalline cellulose was higher than isolated cellulose in the amount of 75\%. The Impedance Spectrometry ({IE}) measurement showed that the ionic conductivity of {PVA}/{LiClO}4/nanocrystalline cellulose membrane is 1.66 × 10−4 S/cm.

	abstract = {Actinide recycling options of spent nuclear fuel are estimated to have many advantages such as reducing nuclear waste, increasing nuclear fuel utilization and improving proliferation resistance aspect of nuclear fuel. Composition of spent nuclear fuel consists of heavy nuclides and fission products including uranium and plutonium as main actinide. In addition, it is also consist of some minor actinides ({MA}) which can be recycled to reduce the volume and radioactive intensity of long-lived radioactive waste and in the same time to increase level of proliferation resistance. In general, some {MAs} can be utilized as useful material such as increasing nuclear fuel production and producing some even mass plutonium such as Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242 as a control material for protected plutonium production. In this paper, identification of even mass plutonium isotopes production for the application of fuel breeding capability and proliferation resistant aspect of isotopic plutonium production was investigated. A large fast breeder reactor ({FBR}) model is adopted by using 800 days operation for one cycling operation for 4 fuel batches systems for optimization and analyses. The analysis of loading {MA} materials into the {FBR} core regions shows the Pu-238 production is increasing significantly as well as additional production of other plutonium isotopes. Isotopic Plutonium production of Pu-238 as main product can be estimated from fuel conversion process of {MA} in the reactor. This fuel conversion phenomena of Pu-238 can be identified as fertile material for fuel breeding capability, that Pu-238 can be converted to Pu-239 by neutron capture which is similar process also for fuel conversion of Pu-240 to Pu-241 as fissile materials. In addition, isotopic production of Pu-239 from converted Pu-238 as additional fuel which can be added with some quantities of Pu-239 production from converted U-238 for extending reactor operation. Production of Pu-238 in the reactor are used for categorizing some level of protected plutonium productions which can increase isotopic barrier level of plutonium in term of decay heat ({DH}) as well as Pu-240 as additional even mass contributor.},

Protease in this fraction has highest activity at {pH} 8.0 and 55°C and its activity of protease was enhanced by the addition of several metal ions. The addition of Fe3+ ion also resulted in a shifting of the optimum {pH} from 8 to 9 and the optimum temperature from 55 to 60°C. Protease of P. stutzeri {BK} {AB}-12 in the fraction of 70−80\% is not likely metallo-, cysteine-, or serine-protease because it is not inhibited by {EDTA}, β-mercaptoethanol, and {PMSF}. Proteases of this fraction was sensitive to ionic strength, where the highest activity was observed at concentrations at {NaCl} concentrations of 2.5M. Beside influenced by the ionic strength, protease activity was also sensitive to solvent polarity. The protease wasstable in the presence of different organic solvents, which enables its potential use for the synthesis of peptides.},

The external forces about 0.125kcal/(mol.Å) was applied in {TMD} to push the closed state of {RmL} lid toward the targeted open state. The results showed that {RmL} lid was fail to reach the targeted structure, in which the final structure was stacked at about 65\% opening. The comparative structural analysis between the partially and fully open states revealed the caused of the sterical hindrance preventing the lid segment to reach the fully open state. Strong hydrophobic interactions among Trp88 with the surrounding non-polar residues in the active site was the major caused for the sterical hindrance. This restriction will protect the active site of the enzyme to be fully exposed to the solvent, thereby minimizing the accessibility of non-substrate molecules into the active site.},

Yet, the holy grail of a workable quantum computing machine still lies faraway at the horizon. In any case, it took nearly several centuries before the vacuum tubes were invented after the first mechanical calculating were constructed, and several decades later, for the transistor to bring the current computer technology to fruition. In this review, we provide a short survey of the current development and progress in quantum information science. It clearly does not do justice to the amount of work in the past thirty years.

The aim of this project is to compare the analytical perfomance results of 90 Sr betavoltaic battery to 63 Ni betavoltaic battery and the source activity influences to performance. Since it has a higher power density, 90 Sr betavoltaic battery yields more power than 63 Ni betavoltaic battery but less radiation-electricity conversion efficiency. However, beta particles emitted from 90 Sr source could travel further inside the silicon corresponding to stopping range of beta particles, thus the 90 Sr betavoltaic battery could be designed thicker than 63 Ni betavoltaic battery to achieve higher conversion efficiency.},

For Fe-U system, the information is mainly obtained from experiment, i.e. {TREAT} experiment. However, there is no reported data on {SS}304 at temperature above 1350°C. The {MPS}\_LER has been developed and validated to simulate melting penetration on Fe-U system. The {MPS}\_LER modelled the eutectic phenomenon by solving the diffusion process and by applying the binary phase diagram criteria. This study simulates the melting penetration of the system at higher temperature using {MPS}\_LER. Simulations were conducted on {SS}304 at 1400, 1450 and 1500°C. The simulation results show rapid increase of melting penetration rate.},

Shale has the typical effective porosity that is changing as a function of time. Effective porosity values for three different shale rocks are analyzed by this proposed measurement. We develop the new measurement method for characterizing porosity phenomena in shale gas as a time function by measuring porosity in a range of minutes using digital helium porosity meter. The porosity of shale rock measured in this experiment are free gas and adsorbed gas porosoty. The pressure change in time shows that porosity of shale contains at least two type porosities: macro scale porosity (fracture porosity) and fine scale porosity (nano scale porosity). We present the estimation of effective porosity values by considering Boyle-Gay Lussaac approximation and Van der Waals approximation.},

At the early development, several studies focused to apply this method for solving problems only in Quantum Mechanics. Nevertheless, Path Integral could also apply to other subjects with some modifications in the propagator function. In this study, we investigate the application of Path Integral method in financial derivatives, stock options. Black-Scholes Model (Nobel 1997) was a beginning anchor in Option Pricing study. Though this model did not successfully predict option price perfectly, especially because its sensitivity for the major changing on market, Black-Scholes Model still is a legitimate equation in pricing an option. The derivation of Black-Scholes has a high difficulty level because it is a stochastic partial differential equation. Black-Scholes equation has a similar principle with Path Integral, where in Black-Scholes the share's initial price is transformed to its final price. The Black-Scholes propagator function then derived by introducing a modified Lagrange based on Black-Scholes equation. Furthermore, we study the correlation between path integral analytical solution and Monte-Carlo numeric solution to find the similarity between this two methods.},

A thermomagnetic rotary engine is one model of it that was designed in the form of a ferromagnetic wheel that can rotates because of magnetization change at Curie temperature. The study is aimed to describe the thermodynamic and mechanical analysis of a thermomagnetic rotary engine and calculate the efficiencies. In thermodynamic view, the ideal processes are isothermal demagnetization, adiabatic demagnetization, isothermal magnetization, and adiabatic magnetization. The values of thermodynamic efficiency depend on temperature difference between hot and cold reservoir. In mechanical view, a rotational work is determined through calculation of moment of inertia and average angular speed. The value of mechanical efficiency is calculated from ratio between rotational work and heat received by system. The study also obtains exergetic efficiency that states the performance quality of the engine.},

In this study, the monitoring of ground water changes was designed by using soil moisture sensor and simple microcontroller for data processing. The performance of soil moisture sensor was calibrated using the gravimetric method. To determine the soil characteristic and behavior with respect to water content that induce landslides, an experiment involving small-scale landslide model was conducted. From these experiments, the electric resistance of the soil increased as soil water content increases. The increase of soil water content led to the rise of the pore pressure and soil weight which could cause soil vulnerability to the movement. In addition, the various soil types were used to determine the responses of soils that induce the slope failure. Experimental results showed that each type of soils has different volumetric water content, soil matrix suction and shear strength of the slope. This condition influenced the slope stability that trigger of landslide.},

The main goal of this method is to construct a student that can think critically, analyze and evaluate problems, and find a new science from these problems (learning by doing). In this paper, {RBL} is used to improve the understanding about measurement using deflection-type Bridge that is implemented in the determination of ground water changes. In general, there are three stages that have been done. Firstly the exposure stage, then the experience stage and lastly the capstone stage. The exposure stage aims to increase the knowledge and the comprehension of student about the topic through understanding the basics concepts, reviewing the literature and others. The understanding gained in the exposure stage is being used for application and analysis at the experience stage.

Here, we analyze the cross-correlation of the fluctuations of the daily closing price of stocks from the Indonesian Stock Exchange ({IDX}) between January 1, 2007, and October 28, 2014. The eigenvalue distribution of the correlation matrix consists of noise which is filtered out using the random matrix as a control. The bulk of the eigenvalue distribution conforms to the random matrix, allowing the separation of random noise from original data which is the deviating eigenvalues. From the deviating eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors, we identify the intrinsic normal modes of the system and interpret their meaning based on qualitative and quantitative approach. The results show that the largest eigenvector represents the market-wide effect which has a predominantly common influence toward all stocks. The other eigenvectors represent highly correlated groups within the system. Furthermore, identification of the largest components of the eigenvectors shows the sector or background of the correlated groups. Interestingly, the result shows that there are mainly two clusters within {IDX}, natural and non-natural resource companies. We then decompose the correlation matrix to investigate the contribution of the correlated groups to the total correlation, and we find that {IDX} is still driven mainly by the market-wide effect.},

	abstract = {Fontainebleau sandstone is sandstone found in one of the cities in France. This sandstone has unique characteristics, which is a clean-fme sandstone, composed of 99\% quartz, virtually devoid of clay, with the grain size of about 200 μm. Fontainebleau sandstone is widely used as a reference in the study of rock microstructure analysis and modelling. In this work analysis regarding the grain and pore size of Fontainebleau is presented. Calculation of 2D pore size and grain size distribution were done on the 299 slice of digital image of the Fontainebleau sandstone using Feret's diameters, equivalent diameters ( d = 4A/P ), and by means of local thickness/separation using plate model. For the 3D grain and pore size distribution, calculation of local thickness and local separation of the structure were used. Two dimensional analysis by means of Feret's diameter and equivalent diameter reveal that both grain and pore size distributions are in the form of reverse-J shaped (right skewed) while the local thickness/separation approach produces almost similar to symmetric Gaussian distribution. Three dimensional analysis produces fairly symmetric Gaussian distribution for both the grain and pore size. Further image processing were conducted and were succeed in producing three dimensional visual of the colour coded structure thickness (grain related) and structure separation (pore related).},

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss modeling and simulation of single dot Single Electron Transistor ({SET}) using master equation approximation. For {SET} modeling and simulation, master equation method treats the electron tunneling and its transition probabilistically. The probability of electron tunneling is used to determine the current density in accordance with selected input parameters. The calculation results show fairly accurate electrical characteristics of {SET} as compared with experimental data. Staircase pattern from I-V are clearly obtained as the main role of coulomb blockade effect in {SET} system. We also extend our calculation by introduce some additional parameters such as; the effect of working temperature, gate voltage dependent, and the influence of resistance to the device characteristic. We found that increasing operational temperature will promote higher current density, both in forward and reverse bias region. In the case of using single dot with 30 nm × 80 nm × 125 nm dimension, coulomb blockade effect could be reduced by applying gate voltage higher than 3V and setting drain resistance higher than source's. Our studies show an alternative approach in modeling and simulation of electronic devices and could be potential for development of novel nanoelectronic devices.},

Landslides are influenced by several factors such as ground slope, degree of rainfall, land cover (ground layers), and the vibration around the slopes. From these factors, tilt detection sensors and soil moisture sensor have been developed to detect landslide failure. These sensors mounted so that it can detect the occurrence of landslides. The study was conducted on a container which contains the sloping ground. Landslide, slope processes, and soil humidity were investigated in this container. {MMA}8451Q accelerometer was used as a tilt sensor to detect the acceleration assembled in {MEMS} (Micro Mechanical System) technology since it is easily available, mass- produced, inexpensive, and high-precision output data. Landslide simulator has been developed hence the process leading to landslide event can be directly analyzed without the need of real life occurrence of landslides. The simulator was made from glass with size 80 cm × 20 cm × 40 cm that was filled by soil.

When the speed of water increased, the pressure would drop at the throat of the venturi causing the outside air to be absorbed via the gas inlet. The gas was then trapped inside the water producing bubbles. The effects of several physical parameters on the characteristics of the bubbles will be discussed thoroughly in this paper. It was found that larger amount of gas pressure during compression will increase the production rate of bubbles and increase the density of bubble within water.},

	abstract = {Ambon Island is a volcanic islands arc and included in the territory of the archipelago of small islands are associated with subduction zones that have a degree of high vulnerability to natural disasters, such as erosion and landslides on the slopes of certain conditions. Landslides that occur various in the city of Ambon, usually occurs during the rainy season so that the impacts that occur not only occurs on site but also off site with amount of large sedimentation. This paper presents the application of digital image analysis techniques and tools Geographic Information Systems to describe the degree of landslide hazard and risk areas in locations Ambon City, Moluccas. The cause of the landslide is analyzed through various thematic layers attribute data for the study area. Landslide hazard zonation assessment is done by using historical data, while the landslide risk analysis is done by using the results of landslide hazard assessment and socioeconomic factors by using geospatial models. The risk assessment of landslides can be used to estimate the risk to the population, property and infrastructure. The study results in the form of a map of landslide hazard and the risk of landslides that act to support urban spatial planning based on disaster mitigation.},

The fault's movement may have caused the formation of sag pond in the vicinity of its which is characterized by the soil layers of the sag pond. The characteristics of the soil can be examined based on its electrical properties such as conductivity (the inverse of resistivity) and dielectric permittivity. Direct field measurement was conducted using {DC}-resistivity Wenner-Schlumberger method on the sag pond as well as laboratory resistivity measurement of cores taken from the sag pond. Two resistivity crosssections were obtained after performing 2D inversion of the data which reveal that the resistivity distribution consist of a resistive layer (40-60 ohm.m) overlying a medium resistive layer (30-35 ohm.m). The third layer has relatively low resistivity of 16-25 ohm.m. At the intersection of these two lines we took coring samples down to depth of 5 m below surface and measured the electrical conductivity and dielectric permittivity for each 1 cm of sample using {EM}-50 data logger. Results from both field and laboratory measurement were analysed to get a better understanding of the sag pond.},

These equations are used in the case of Transverse Electric polarization ({TE}) and Transverse Magnetic polarization ({TM}).

In response to this, one innovation to do is to make an instrument which is able to mix biogas and air by venture pipe using the basic theory of fluid mechanic, in order to raise the use of biogas as electricity source. Biogas conversion is done by changing fuel in benzene 5 kilowatt genset to biogas so it becomes a biogas genset. The biogas pressure is controlled when it enters the mixer instrument so that the velocity of biogas when it enters and it comes out the mixer is the same, and it will gain different pressure between biogas and air. By the pressure difference between biogas in the mixer instrument, biogas goes to the burning room so that the conversion of mechanical energy biogas to electricity will happen, and it will be applied as light and society's needs.},

Geophysicists often use well logging to obtain reservoir properties such as porosity, water saturation and permeability. Most of the time, the measurement of the reservoir properties are considered expensive. One of method to substitute the measurement is by conducting a prediction using artificial neural network. In this paper, artificial neural network is performed to predict porosity log data from other log data. Three well from ‘yy’ field are used to conduct the prediction experiment. The log data are sonic, gamma ray, and porosity log. One of three well is used as training data for the artificial neural network which employ the Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation algorithm. Through several trials, we devise that the most optimal input training is sonic log data and gamma ray log data with 10 hidden layer. The prediction result in well 1 has correlation of 0.92 and mean squared error of 5.67 x10 -4 . Trained network apply to other well data. The result show that correlation in well 2 and well 3 is 0.872 and 0.9077 respectively. Mean squared error in well 2 and well 3 is 11 x 10 -4 and 9.539 x 10 -4 . From the result we can conclude that sonic log and gamma ray log could be good combination for predicting porosity with neural network.},

One of the characteristics of fractal structure is the scale independence. An investigation of fractal properties on natural fractured rock is therefore needed for modelling larger fracture. We have investigated the possibilities of fractal upscaling method to produce a larger geothermal fracture model based on smaller fracture data. We generate Iterated Function System ({IFS}) fractal model using parameters e.g. scale factor, angle between branch, initial line direction, and branch thickness. All the model parameters are obtained from smaller fracture data. We generate higher iteration model to be compared with larger geothermal fracture. The similarity between the {IFS} fractal model and natural fracture is measured by 2D box counting fractal dimension (D). The fractal dimension of first to fourth generation fractal model is (1.86 ± 0.02). The fractal dimension of the reference geothermal site is (1.86 ± 0.04). Besides of D, we found significant similarity of fracture parameters there are intensity and density between fracture model and natural fracture. Based on these result, we conclude that fractal upscaling using {IFS} fractal model is potential to model larger scale of 2D fracture.},

But experimentally it had been proven that significantly viscosity had an influence to fiber diameter. Jet radius equation in electrospinning process was divided into three areas: near the nozzle, far from the nozzle, and at jet terminal. There was no correlation between these equations. Superposition of exponential series model provides the equations combined into one, thus the entire of working parameters on electrospinning take a contribution to fiber diameter.

One of challenging problems is to implement this method for the case of light propagation in amplifying medium or structures, such as optical amplifier and lasers. The implementation is hindered by the fact that the dielectric constant becomes a complex number when optical gain parameter is involved in the calculation. In general, complex dielectric constant is related to complex susceptibility, in which the imaginary part is related to optical gain. Here, we then modify the formulation for updating electric field in the calculation algorithm. Using this approach, we then finally can calculate light amplification in laser active medium of Nd 3+ ion doped glass. The calculation result shows an agreement with the result from the calculation using differential equation for intensity.

	abstract = {Mendong (Fimbristylis globulosa) has a potentially industrial application. We investigate a predictive model for heat and mass transfer in drying kinetics during drying a Mendong. We experimentally dry the Mendong by using a microwave oven. In this study, we analyze three mathematical equations and feed forward neural network ({FNN}) with back propagation to describe the drying behavior of Mendong. Our results show that the experimental data and the artificial neural network model has a good agreement and better than a mathematical equation approach. The best {FNN} for the prediction is 3-20-1-1 structure with Levenberg- Marquardt training function. This drying kinetics modeling is potentially applied to determine the optimal parameters during mendong drying and to estimate and control of drying process.},

This approach is a variant of standard finite element method and commonly referred as vector finite-element ({VFE}) method. Nonphysical solutions usually occurred when the solution is sought using standard finite element which is a node based element. Vector finite element attempt to overcome those nonphysical solutions by using the edges of the element as vector basis. The proposed approach on solving second order Maxwell differential equation of 3-D {MT} is using direct solver rather than iterative method. Therefore, divergence correction to accelerate the rate of convergence for its iterative solution is no longer needed. The utilization of direct solver has been verified previously for correctness by comparing the resulting solution to those given by analytical solution, as well as the solution come from the other numerical methods, for earth layered model, 2-D models and {COMMEMI} 3D-2 model.

Microscope is a tool that uses two convex lenses as the eyepiece and objective lens because it can form a magnified image. Instead concave lens is usually used as a spectacle lens for nearsightedness patients because the distance of image formed is closer than the distance of the object. Just like a mirror, the image formation by lenses also can be conveniently determined with ray diagrams. Therefore, this research aims to create a simulation of ray diagrams in the process of image formation by lenses and their applications using Macro Visual Basic in Microsoft {PowerPoint}. Lenses applications made are the microscope simulation and the combined lenses which consist of a concave-convex lens combined and a convex-concave lens combined. This research begins with the preparation of material on the image formation by lenses and their application. Second, made an appearance on the program which consists of a {PowerPoint} slide, {CommandButton}, Textbox, {OptionButton}, Shape and others then wrote programs in Macro Visual Basic procedure to active the command to do. Input of this simulation can be given in the form of object distance, focal point distance of lens and height of objects. The data will be processed according to commands contained in macros procedure to result image distance, image height, image magnification and the properties of image. In addition to result the data, media can also provide output in the form of ray diagrams simulation on the image formation that can be used to assist students understanding the image formation by lenses.},

The effects of inhomogeneities on radiation dose distributions depend on the amount, density and atomic number of the inhomogeneity, as well as on the quality of the photon beam. Good agreement between dose distribution from {EGSnrc} and Geant4 code system in inhomogeneity phantom was observed, with dose differences around 5\% and 7\% for depth doses and dose profiles.},

The free energies are then calculated to asses the most favorable orientation, indicating its stable structure, of this peptide interacting with the lipid bilayer. Umbrella sampling with and without pulling simulations is carried out to obtain the sampling windows which used in observing the free energy changes along the reaction coordinate. From our simulations, we found that melittin in vertical orientation in transmembrane state has smaller free energy value than the horizontal one indicating that melittin is more favorable in this configuration.

Theophylline was employed as a template and it formed a complex with {MAA} through hydrogen bonding. Self-assembly of template-monomer was followed by cross-linking process using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ({EGDMA}) cross-linker. The polymerization process was initiated by thermal decomposition of benzoyl peroxide ({BPO}) as the initiator at 60 o C after cooling treatment at -5 o C. After 7 hours, a rigid polymer was obtained and followed by grinding the polymer and removing the template. As a reference, a nonimprinted polymer ({NIP}) has also been synthesized using similar procedure by excluding the template. {FTIR} study was carried out to investigate the presence of theophylline in the as- prepared polymer, {MIP}, and {NIP}. The spectra indicated that theophylline was successfully incorporated in the as-prepared polymer. This result was also confirmed by {EDS} analysis showing that N atoms of the as-prepared polymer were derived from amino group of theophylline. Furthermore, the polymer particles of {MIP} were irregular in shape and size as shown by its {SEM} image. The capability of guest-rebinding of the {MIP} was analyzed through Batchwise guest-binding experiment. The results showed that for initial concentration of theophylline in methanol/chloroform (1/1, v/v) of 0.333 {mM}, the binding capacity of the {MIP} was 23.22 /mol/g. Compared to the {MIP}, the adsorption capacity of the {NIP} was only 3.73 /mol/g. This result shows that {MIP} has higher affinity than {NIP}.},

With the help of a lecturer and a tutor as facilitators, they have followed this series of steps: 1. Start with a driving question, a problem to be solved, 2. Exploring the driving question by participating in authentic, situated inquiry, 3. Engaging collaborative activities with lecturer and tutor to find solutions to the driving question, 4. Scaffolding with learning technologies that help students participating in activities normally beyond their ability, and 5. Creating a set of tangible products that address the driving question. With this series of steps, the students have become easier to understand the lectures that have been given and the instrument has been realized to measure the temperature of water properly. When realizing the project under the {PBL} method, we learned other materials beside that have been taught in the course.

In this work, different {TiO} 2 layers with different thickness and heat treatment were prepared and then used to build a complete sandwich-type {DSSC}. The characterization results show that the power conversion efficiency ({PCE}) is slightly reduced when using {TiO} 2 layer with multiple scattering layers. This reduction is caused by an increase in the resistance from charge transport and charge transfer inside the mesoporous {TiO} 2 layer, as revealed from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement results. Additional heat treatment introduced at the final step in the {TiO} 2 layer preparation process, however, slightly improve the cell performance. Although this heat treatment does not produce significant change in porosity or pore size distribution of the {TiO} 2 layer, it might be able to improve the contact between the {TiO} 2 nanoparticles. The best {PCE} achieved in this work is about 5.3\%, which was observed in the cell using {TiO} 2 layer with one scattering layer and additional heat treatment.},

The average of contactopy without intruder system toward ratio of granular bed diameter and the width of shaking place giving logarithmic equation \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-6596/739/1/012135/{JPCS}\_739\_1\_012135ieqn1.gif] \${\textbackslash}Delta C = - 210,5ln ({\textbackslash}{fracdL}) - 443,56\$ . This equation show the value of contactopy without intruder system under certain ratio of granular bed diameter and the width of shaking place. Potential energy change for both system without intruder and with intruder are decreasing as the height system is decreasing. These result show that compaction inhibit Brazil nut effect phenomena still obey the minimum energy principle ({MEP}). The whole results of this research confirm that increasing contactopy and decreasing potential energy not only valid for Brazil nut effect, but also for compaction inhibit Brazil nut effect phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Ground Penetrating Radar ({GPR}) survey was carried out in several petroleum plants to investigate hydrocarbon contamination beneath the surface. The hydrocarbon spills are generally recognized as Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids ({LNAPL}) if the plume of leakage is distributed in the capillary fringe above the water table and as Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids ({DNAPL}) if it is below the water table. {GPR} antennas of 200 {MHz} and 400 {MHz} were deployed to obtain clear radargrams until 4 m deep. In general, the interpreted radargram sections indicate the presence of surface concrete layer, the compacted silty soill followed by sand layer and the original clayey soil as well as the water table. The presence of hydrocarbon plumes are identified as shadow zones (radar velocity and intensity contrasts) in the radargram that blur the layering pattern with different intensity of reflected signal. Based on our results, the characteristic of the shadow zones in the radargram is controlled by several factors: types of hydrocarbon (fresh or bio-degraded), water moisture in the soil, and clay content which contribute variation in electrical conductivity and dielectric constants of the soil.},

	abstract = {2D Resistivity and Induced Polarization ({IP}) survey was conducted to delineate the presence of minerals containing manganese in form of manganese ore. The resistivity method concerns with resistivity (ohm.m) of rocks which indicates the electrical properties in terms of ability to resist the flow of electrical current. The presence of manganese in rocks generally lowers the resistivity. The Induced Polarization ({IP}) method deals with chargeability (in msec) which indicates the strength of polarization effects experienced by ions in the vicinity of metallic grains in rock. The presence of manganese in rocks increases the chargeability of the rock when measured using {IP} method. The low resistivity zones ({\textless} 5 ohm.m) are situated in the western part, central part, and eastern part of the investigated area. These zones may strongly correlate to the presence of manganese ore. However, these low resistivity zones may have been influenced by the presence of clay or weathered soil. In this case, the high chargeability zones will help in confirming the prospective zones caused by manganese ore. The thicknesses of the manganese ore layer vary from about 5 to 20 m based on the cross-sections. Based on the results, we estimated the geometry of the associated manganese prospective zones for resistivity (10 msec).},

The project was a weight meter using a d.c. deflection-type bridge circuit and a {VU} meter, which was realized by a group of three students (the first three authors). We were of the 2 nd year of undergraduate physics program that are taking the Measurement and Data Processing Techniques course in the period of January to April 2015. We worked together with our lecturer and tutor as our advisers. In making the weight meter, we have done the following roles in {PjBL}: 1. Planning the project and setting a timeline, 2. Doing research, 3. Creating first draft, 4. Rewriting the project report, and 5. Submitting the project. Under the guidance of timeline, the project has been completed timely. A force sensing resistor ({FSR}) sensor was employed to convert a body mass to resistance of the bridge circuit and the {VU} meter was modified to be a display of the weight meter. The weight meter could be used to measure a body mass up to 5 kg.},

Granular materials in a vertical rotating drum usually have six modes of motion i.e. slipping, slumping, rolling, cascading, cataracting, and centrifuging. Those modes depend on number of granular particles, rotation speed, and types of materials of granular particles. Characterization of modes of motion in this work has been conducted by varying number of particles, rotation speed, and types of materials. Rotation speed is varied from 15 rpm to 125 rpm, while number of granular material is varied from 50 to 600.

	abstract = {Budding yeast can exhibit colony formation in solid substrate. The colony of pathogenic budding yeast can colonize various surfaces of the human body and medical devices. Furthermore, it can form biofilm that resists drug effective therapy. The formation of the colony is affected by the interaction between cells and with its growth media. The cell budding pattern holds an important role in colony expansion. To study this colony growth, the molecular dynamic method was chosen to simulate the interaction between budding yeast cells. Every cell was modelled by circular granular cells, which can grow and produce buds. Cohesion force, contact force, and Stokes force govern this model to mimic the interaction between cells and with the growth substrate. Characterization was determined by the maximum ( L max ) and minimum ( L min ) distances between two cells within the colony and whether two lines that connect the two cells in the maximum and minimum distances intersect each other. Therefore, it can be recognized the colony shape in circular, oval, and irregular shapes. Simulation resulted that colony formation are mostly in oval shape with little branch. It also shows that greater cohesion strength obtains more compact colony formation.},

This study takes X geothermal field, which is the pioneer of Indonesia’s geothermal development. Therefore, it should be maintained for long period by doing proper production and reinjection activities. Hypocenters of microseismic events is represented movements of reinjection fluids that means it could be space where fractured zone is formed. We use Single Event Determination ({SED}) method to relocate the hypocenters of microseismic event during the period of January - June 2014. About 179 events of micro earthquake were recorded on that period, these micro earthquake have magnitudes in range of 0.4 to 2.1 {SR}. Some of them are related to reinjection fluid from injection well {INJ}21. The hypocenters which is related to injection fluid from {INJ}21 shows that fractured zones exist on there. These fractured zones is located in geothermal reservoirs based on the geological setting. Fractured zones caused by high pressure of reinjection fluid where it happens in geothermal reservoirs containing high temperature, when reinjection water contacted with high temperature reservoir, it will be a new fractured zones because of high intensity of micro earthquake events.},

Currently existing monitoring systems for early warning are available in terms of monolithic systems. This is a very cost-intensive way, considering installation as well as operational and personal expenses. We have been developing a landslide detection system based on flat coil and coil sensor. The flat coil element being developed is an inductive proximity sensor for detection mass of soil movement. The simple method of flat coil manufactures and low cost, is an attraction that is still inspired to develop flat coil sensors. Meanwhile, although it has a drawback in terms of their size, the coil sensor is still required in many fields due to their sensitivity and robustness. The simple method of coil manufacture and the materials are commonly available and low cost, is an attraction that is still inspired to develop induction coil sensors. A comparative study of alternative configuration of sensor based on flat coil elements and a coil in application to landslide detection has been discussed in this paper. The purpose of this comparison is to show the ideal conditions and the challenges for each sensor. Furthermore, a comparison between flat coil and coil sensor is presented.},

In {TG} tetrad fields are defined to express gravitational fields and act like gauge potentials in standard gauge theory. The lagrangians for the gravitational field in {TG} and for the Yang-Mills field in standard gauge theory differ due to different indices that stick on the components of the corresponding fields: two external indices for tetrad field and internal and external indices for the Yang-Mills field. Different types of indices lead to different possible contractions and thus lead to different expression of the lagrangian for the Yang Mills field and for the tetrad field. As {TG} is a gauge theory it is then natural to quantize gravity in {TG} by applying the same procedure of quantization as in the standard gauge theory. Here we will discuss on the possibility to quantize gravity, canonically and functionally, under the framework of {TG} theory.},

Furthermore, the effect of physical parameters to the quality of radiographic images and the comparison of image quality resulted from simulation in the {GPU} and {CPU} are evaluated in this paper. The simulations were run in {CPU} which was simulated in serial condition, and in two {GPU} with 384 cores and 2304 cores. In simulation using {GPU}, each cores calculates one photon, so, a large number of photon were calculated simultaneously. Results show that the time simulations on {GPU} were significantly accelerated compared to {CPU}. The simulations on the 2304 core of {GPU} were performed about 64 -114 times faster than on {CPU}, while the simulation on the 384 core of {GPU} were performed about 20 – 31 times faster than in a single core of {CPU}. Another result shows that optimum quality of images from the simulation was gained at the history start from 108 and the energy from 60 Kev to 90 Kev.

This reactor can be operated without enrichment and reprocessing forever, once it starts. To obtain the capability of consuming natural uranium as fuel cycle input modified {CANDLE} burn-up scheme was adopted in this system with different core design. This study has compared the core with three designs of core reactors with the same thermal power 600 {MWth}. The fuel composition each design was arranged by divided core into several parts of equal volume axially i.e. 6, 8 and 10 parts related to material burn-up history. The fresh natural uranium is initially put in region 1, after one cycle of 10 years of burn-up it is shifted to region 2 and the region 1 is filled by fresh natural uranium fuel. This concept is basically applied to all regions, i.e. shifted the core of the region (i) into region (i+1) region after the end of 10 years burn-up cycle. The calculation results shows that for the burn-up strategy on “Region-8” and “Region-10” core designs, after the reactors start-up the operation furthermore they only needs natural uranium supply to the next life operation until one period of refueling (10 years).},

The center of mass approach used a simple Coulomb friction model to determine the run-out distance. Results of the slope stability analysis showed that the soil unit weight can influence the depth of sliding zone, and the volume of unstable material. The slope model of silty sand and gravel would have the largest volume of unstable mass. From the Coulomb friction analysis, this slope model has higher run-out distance and velocity than other slope models.

	abstract = {Permeability plays an important role to determine the characteristics of how fluids flow through a porous medium which can be estimated using various methods. Darcy's law and the Kozeny-Carman equation are two of the most utilized methods in estimating permeability. In Darcy's law, permeability can be calculated by applying a pressure gradient between opposing sides of inlet-outlet of a certain direction. The permeability then depends on the fluid viscosity and the flowrate. The Kozeny-Carman equation is an empirical equation which depends on several parameters such as shape factor of the pore, tortuosity, specific surface area, and porosity to determine the permeability. For both methods, digital image obtained by means of Micro {CT}-Scan is used. In this research, the permeability estimation using the Darcy's law was conducted by simulating fluid flow through the digital image using Lattice Boltzmann Method ({LBM}). As for the Kozeny-Carman equation, digital image analysis was used to obtain the required parameters. Two Kozeny-Carman equations were used to calculate the permeability of the samples. The first equation ({KC}1) depends on pore shape factor, porosity, tortuosity, and specific surface area while the second equation ({KC}2) only depends on pore radius, porosity, and tortuosity. We investigate the methods by first testing on three simple pipe models which vary in the radii. By using the result from Darcy's law as a reference, we compare the results from the Kozeny-Carman equations. From the calculation, {KC}2 yield smaller difference to the reference. The three methods were then applied to the Fontainebleau sandstone to verify the previous result.},

	abstract = {The non-discharges geothermal wells have been a main problem in geothermal development stages and well discharge stimulation is required to initiate a flow. Air compress stimulation is one of the methods to trigger a fluid flow from the geothermal reservoir. The result of this process can be predicted by using by the Af / Ac method, but sometimes this method shows uncertainty result in several geothermal wells and also this prediction method does not take into account the flowing time of geothermal fluid to discharge after opening the well head. This paper presents a simulation of non-discharges well under air compress stimulation to predict well behavior and time process required. The component of this model consists of geothermal well data during heating-up process such as pressure, temperature and mass flow in the water column and main feed zone level. The one-dimensional transient numerical model is run based on the Single Fluid Volume Element ({SFVE}) method. According to the simulation result, the geothermal well behavior prediction after air compress stimulation will be valid under two specific circumstances, such as single phase fluid density between 1 - 28 kg/m 3 and above 28.5 kg/m 3 . The first condition shows that successful well discharge and the last condition represent failed well discharge after air compress stimulation (only for two wells data). The comparison of pf values between simulation and field observation shows the different result according to the success discharge well. Time required for flow to occur as observed in well head by using the {SFVE} method is different with the actual field condition. This model needs to improve by updating more geothermal well data and modified fluid phase condition inside the wellbore.},

	abstract = {Earth attenuates high frequencies from seismic wavelet. Low frequency seismics cannot be obtained by low quality geophone. The low frequencies (0-10 Hz) that are not present in seismic data are important to obtain a good result in acoustic impedance ({AI}) inversion. {AI} is important to determine reservoir quality by converting {AI} to reservoir properties like porosity, permeability and water saturation. The low frequencies can be supplied from impedance log ({AI} logs), velocity analysis, and from the combination of both data. In this study, we propose that the low frequencies could be obtained from the envelope seismic attribute. This new proposed method is essentially a modified {BLIMP} (Band Limited Impedance) inversion method, in which the {AI} logs for {BLIMP} substituted with the envelope attribute. In low frequency domain (0-10 Hz), the envelope attribute produces high amplitude. This low frequency from the envelope attribute is utilized to replace low frequency from {AI} logs in {BLIMP}. Linear trend in this method is acquired from the {AI} logs. In this study, the method is applied on synthetic seismograms created from impedance log from well ‘X’. The mean squared error from the modified {BLIMP} inversion is 2-4\% for each trace (variation in error is caused by different normalization constant), lower than the conventional {BLIMP} inversion which produces error of 8\%. The new method is also applied on Marmousi2 dataset and show promising result. The modified {BLIMP} inversion result from Marmousi2 by using one log {AI} is better than the one produced from the conventional method.},

As we know neutrons can be emitted from a medical accelerator if there is an incident of X-ray that hits any of its materials. This issue becomes a point of view of many researchers. The neutron contamination has caused many problems such as image resolution and radiation protection for patients and radio oncologists. This study concerns the simulation of neutron contamination emitted from Varian Clinac {iX} 10 {MV} using Monte Carlo code system. As neutron production process is very complex, Monte Carlo simulation with {MCNPX} code system was carried out to study this contamination. The design of this medical accelerator was modelled based on the actual materials and geometry. The maximum energy of photons and neutron in the scoring plane was 10.5 and 2.239 {MeV}, respectively. The number and energy of the particles produced depend on the depth and distance from beam axis. From these results, it is pointed out that the neutron produced by linac 10 {MV} photon beam in a typical treatment is not negligible.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the profile of the {CT} scan output dose in both axial and helical modes using convolution. A single scan output dose profile ({SSDP}) in the center of a head phantom was measured using a solid-state detector. The multiple scan output dose profile ({MSDP}) in the axial mode was calculated using convolution between {SSDP} and delta function, whereas for the helical mode {MSDP} was calculated using convolution between {SSDP} and the rectangular function. {MSDPs} were calculated for a number of scans (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25). The multiple scan average dose ({MSAD}) for differing numbers of scans was compared to the value of {CT} dose index ({CTDI}). Finally, the edge values of {MSDP} for every scan number were compared to the corresponding {MSAD} values. {MSDPs} were successfully generated by using convolution between a {SSDP} and the appropriate function. We found that {CTDI} only accurately estimates {MSAD} when the number of scans was more than 10. We also found that the edge values of the profiles were 42\% to 93\% lower than that the corresponding {MSADs}.},

	abstract = {Image processing is important in diagnosing diseases or damages of human organs. One of the important stages of image processing is segmentation process. Segmentation is a separation process of the image into regions of certain similar characteristics. It is used to simplify the image to make an analysis easier. The case raised in this study is image segmentation of bones. Bone's image segmentation is a way to get bone dimensions, which is needed in order to make prosthesis that is used to treat broken or cracked bones. Segmentation methods chosen in this study are fast marching and geodesic active contours. This study uses {ITK} (Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit) software. The success of the segmentation was then determined by calculating its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Based on the results, the Active Contours method has slightly higher accuracy and sensitivity values than the fast marching method. As for the value of specificity, fast marching has produced three image results that have higher specificity values compared to those of geodesic active contour's. The result also indicates that both methods have succeeded in performing bone's image segmentation. Overall, geodesic active contours method is quite better than fast marching in segmenting bone images.},

These three methods require one important parameter, i.e the threshold. The threshold interval was obtained from the histogram of the original image. The software used to segment the image here was {InsightToolkit}-4.7.0 ({ITK}). This research used 5 lung images to be analyzed. Then, the results were compared using the performance evaluation parameter determined by using {MATLAB}. The segmentation method is said to have a good quality if it has the smallest {MSE} value and the highest {PSNR}. The results show that four sample images match the criteria of connected threshold, while one sample refers to the threshold level set segmentation.

The analysis shows information of the composition of the six scanned stones obtained. The six stones consist of stone number 1 (calcium+cystine), number 2 (calcium+struvite), number 3 (calcium+cystine+struvite), number 4 (calcium), number 5 (calcium+cystine+struvite), and number 6 (calcium+uric acid).

As H-bonds account for specificity, we only consider the dynamics affected by H-bonds between {DNA} base pairs and H-bonds connecting protein side chains and {DNA}. The H-bonds are modelled by Morse potentials and coupling terms in the Hamiltonian of coupled oscillators resembling a coupling between planar {DNA} chain and a protein molecule. In this paper we give a perturbative approach as an attempt for a soliton solution.

The aim of this study is to investigate the compartment model as a structure of a cell and diffusion process inside a cell and nucleus by using Monte Carlo simulation. {MCell} was used to analyze the compartment model for mechanisms inside a cell and nucleus. Compartment model consist two icosphere with different size, with cell diameter for 0.8 μm and nucleus diameter varies for about 0.4, 0.5, and 6 μm, respectively. Another parameter was their width and a model of receptor on the surface of the nucleus. During investigation, an amount of receptor was 120, 150, and 180 grid element. The model was collected and separated. The diffusion process flew from cell to the nucleus and returned to the cell with 2000 molecules on surface. {MCell} successfully simulated compartment model for a cell and the nucleus. Diffusion process depended on the diameter of the nucleus. The greater the nucleus, more effective the speed of diffusion process would be because the concentration inside the cell was increase and concentration in the nucleus was decrease.},

To address this issue, in the moment of the total solar eclipse of 9 March 2016 passing most regions in Indonesia, we undertook microgravity measurements using two precise gravimeters. The measurements were made at two locations: (1) Poso (central Sulawesi), a location close to the centre passage of the total eclipse and (2) Lembang (West Java), the site of Bosscha Observatory, where the partial solar eclipse occurred. The two sites are selected to measure the possible different influence of the eclipse on aligning the three objects. The measurements were recorded three days before and one day after the eclipse at various intervals from 30 seconds to a short time at 5 seconds. The finer recording was performed several hours before and after the total eclipse. This measurement allowed detailed analysis, not only in time but also in frequency range. A detailed analysis is presented in this paper. We consider all possible geophysical as well as atmospheric effects. The residual data show that the shielding effect, usually thought as responsible factor on anomalous gravity, is not significant.},

Time-resolved imaging of the Sun has been conducted before, after, and during totality of eclipse while optical spectroscopic observation has been carried out only at the totality. The imaging observation in white light was done to take high resolution images of solar corona. The images were taken with a {DSLR} camera that is attached to a refractor telescope (d=66 mm, f/5.9). Despite cloudy weather during the eclipse moments, we managed to obtain the images with lower signal-to-noise ratio, including identifiable diamond ring, prominence and coronal structure. The images were processed using standard reduction procedure to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to enhance the corona. Then, the coronal structure is determined and compared with ultraviolet data from {SOHO} to analyze the correlation between visual and ultraviolet corona. The spectroscopic observation was conducted using a slit-less spectrograph and a {DSLR} camera to obtain solar flash spectra. The flash spectra taken during the eclipse show emissions of H 4861 Å, He I 5876 Å, and H 6563 Å. The Fe {XIV} 5303 Å and Fe X 6374 Å lines are hardly detected due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Spectral reduction and analysis are conducted to derive the emission lines intensity relative to continuum intensity. We use the measured parameters to determine the temperature of solar chromosphere.},

Next, we calculated the length of prominence from {TSE} images, and found that the real minimum length of prominence in red is 1.05 times longer than green and blue ones. And, the real maximum length of prominence is 1.08 times longer than blue and 1.04 times longer than green. The intensity of red is brighter 1.37 times to green and 1.23 times to blue. The causes of the results due to the different temperatures of the prominences and the radiation from H-alpha emission.

The aim of this research is to understand the effect of moon craters on the appearance of solar corona and identification of solar active regions during {TSE}. This research was done using Canon {SX}170 {IS} camera with {ND} 5 sun-filter. Although the sky was cloudy during the totality of the phase, coronal video was still taken. Camera also took solar images of partial eclipse phase. Coronal images for every frame were then extracted from the video. Image processing of coronal images was done using {RegiStax} and {PhotoScape} freewares. To study solar corona, images from Virtual Moon Atlas, Hinode {XRT}, and {SOHO}-{LASCO} were compared with the result of oriented coronal image. Wider and many more moon craters were found having positive correlation with the brighter effect on solar corona as shown at westward coronal streamer. Those craters are represented by Bel'kovich crater, the biggest one. We also found that only the eastward coronal streamer was correlated with active region, sunspot number 12519, from behind solar limb.},

The other team did the observation on Ma Chung University campus, Malang, to accompany people who want to see the partial solar eclipse through filtered telescopes. The sky during the solar eclipse was clear both in Malang and Palu. People were very excited and satisfied with the solar eclipse, and their interest to astronomy is increased.},

The aim of this project is to study the relation between the number of accesses to the media information and how well public learned the information delivered by the media. We prepared questionnaire consisting of seven semi-multiple choices on how public got information about {TSE}. We gave them choices of what they had heard to measure their basic understanding of {TSE}. Furthermore we add two “wrong” choices in the last questions to identify less serious respondents. We analyze 60 respondents of Palembang who visited Ampera bridge area. Our result shows no correlation between the number of information access and the level of understanding about {TSE}.

Misconception is defined as a thought or an idea that is different from what has been agreed by experts who are reliable in the field, and it is believed to interfere with the acquisition of new understanding and integration of new knowledge or skills. While lack of concept or knowledge can be corrected with the next instruction and learning, students who have misconceptions have to “unlearn” their misconception before learning a correct one. Therefore, the ability to differentiate between these two things becomes crucial. {CRI} is one of the methods that can identify efficiently, between misconceptions and lack of knowledge that occur in the students. This research used quantitative- descriptive method with ex-post-facto research approach. An instrument used for the test is astronomy questions that require an understanding of physics concepts to solve the problem. By using astronomy questions, it is expected to raise a better understanding such that a concept can be viewed from various fields of science. Based on test results, misconceptions are found on several topics of physics. This test also revealed that student's ability to analyse a problem is still quite low.},

To obtain more reliable physical quantities of {NGC} 6543 and {NGC} 7662, the use of photoionization model is needed. We use the computer code, {CLOUDY} C13.3 to build detailed photoionization models of {NGC} 6543 and {NGC} 7662. Model of {NGC} 6543 and 7662 can be constructed by providing sufficient information on physical parameters of the central stars and the nebula. In this work, input parameters to construct the photoionization model of {NGC} 6543 and {NGC} 7662 are distance, temperature and luminosity of central star and nebula parameters. The model results were compared with observational result taken in 2014. Observed and modeled temperatures were deduced from [O {III}] λλ(4959 + 5007) Å /λ4636 Å and the electron density from [S {II}] λλ 6716/6731 Å. There are some discrepancies between observed and modeled due to limitations inherent with the resolution and quality of spectroscopic data. Further spectroscopic observations with higher resolution of {NGC} 6543 and {NGC} 7662 is recommended.},

	abstract = {The sky brightness measurements were performed using a portable photometer. A pocket-sized and low-cost photometer has 20 degree area measurement, and spectral ranges between 320-720 nm with output directly in magnitudes per arc second square (mass) unit. The sky brightness with 3 seconds temporal resolutions was recorded at Jogyakarta city (110° 25’ E; 70° 52’ S; elevation 100 m) within 136 days in years from 2014 to 2016. The darkest night could reach 22.61 mpass only in several seconds, with mean value 18.8±0.7 mpass and temperature variation 23.1±1.2 C. The difference of mean sky brightness between before and after midnight was about -0.76 mpass or 2.0 times brighter. Moreover, the sky brightness and temperature fluctuations were more stable in after midnight than in before midnight. It is suggested that city light pollution affects those variations, and subsequently duration of twilight. By comparing twilight brightness for several places, we also suggest a 17° solar dip or about 66 minutes before sunrise for new time of Fajr prayer.},

Some miss-information and a bad impression can be felt by children who do not understand about {TSE} that causes momentary darkness during totality phase. Therefore we designed a children education programs about the {TSE} that as follow: (1) socialization about {TSE}, (2) Popular astronomy seminar, (3) How to observe the Sun? (4) writing competition about {TSE} and (5) {TSE} observation. The events were held on March 8 th - 9 th 2016. More than 200 representatives of elementary school students and teachers throughout Palangkaraya have actively participated. The keynote speaker was an Indonesian expert astronomer with help from alumni of astronomy olympiad in order to provide inspiration for the participants, especially to the students. We conclude that students as young generation of the nation may have more motivation to work in science by direct learning from natural phenomena.},

	abstract = {Koren-Feingold ({KF}) model, a model that relates growth of cloud thickness ( H ) and cloud number concentration ( N ) is discussed and analyzed in this work. Two boundary conditions are required by this model, where the first is cloud thickness potential H 0 and the second is aerosol concentration N 0 . The initial conditions are simply H (0) = 0 and N (0) = 0. Several pairs of (H 0 , N 0 ) values are chosen in calculating the precipitation. Three categories of rainfall are used in this work, which are no drizzle D0, light drizzle D1, and drizzle D2. As H evolves in time t , it produces maximum cloud thickness H max and saturation cloud thickness H sat , as also N does N max and N sat . Two kinds of cloud thickness difference, Δ H 1 = H 0 - H ma x and Δ H 2 = H 0 - H sat are proposed and also for cloud concentration difference Δ N 1 and Δ N 2 with similar definitions. Pairs of (Δ H 1 , Δ N 1 ) and (Δ H 2 , Δ N 2 ) are used in analyzing simulation results. The first pair can be used as prediction of rainfall occurrence, while the second pair is more for confirmation and understanding the relation between cloud thickness and cloud concentration in producing rainfall. It is observed that H {\textless} H 0 and N {\textless} N 0 are always fulfilled. Rainfall in category D2 will have significant differences in H and N , while in category D0 will not. Typical differences for H are about 80\% and 30-50\% for both cases. Deeper discussion about (Δ H 1 , Δ N 1 ) and (Δ H 2 , Δ N 2 ) is presented in this work.},

Using the {MCS} data and radiative transfer model coupled with an automated inversion routine, we can investigate the chemical composition of the high altitude clouds. We will present the first results on the properties of the clouds. {CO} 2 ice is the best candidate to be the main component of some high altitude clouds due to the most similar spectral variation compared to water ice or dust, in agreement with previous studies. Using cloud composition of contaminated {CO} 2 ice (dust core surrounded by {CO} 2 ice) might improve the fitting result, but further study is needed.},

In planar case it possesses five equilibrium points consisting of three collinear (L 1 , L 2 , and L 3 ) and two triangular (L 4 and L 5 ). To mimic a better astrophysical R3BP, such as motion of a satellite in star-planet system, the classical problem can be generalized by considering the effects of radiation pressure and oblate spheroid shape on the primaries. We study analytically the locations and the stability of L 4 and L 5 equilibrium points in the frame of {ER}3BP with incorporating the effects of radiation for bigger primary and oblateness for smaller primary. Our study suggests that the oblateness factor (A 2 ) and the radiation factor (q 1 ) shift the positions of L 4 and L 5 points compared with the classical ones. We also find that there is a stability limit for motion of the third body around these points.},

After some corrections (stretch (s), colour (c), K-corrections, etc.), the variations in the light curves of {SNe} Ia can be suppressed to be no more than 10\%. Their high luminosity and almost uniform intrinsic brightness at the peak light, i.e. M B ∼ -19, make {SNe} Ia ideal standard candle. Because of their visibility from large distances, {SNe} Ia can be employed as a cosmological measuring tool. It was analysis of {SNe} Ia data that indicated for the first time, that the universe is not only expanding, but also accelerating. This work analyzed a compilation of {SNe} Ia data to determine several cosmological parameters (H 0 , Ω m , Ω a , and w ).

There are two methods that commonly used to study the characteristics of {ULXs}. One method is to study the X-ray spectra of {ULXs}, to determine the characteristics of their accretion flows from fitting their spectra using available spectral models. The other method is to investigate how population of {ULXs} correlate with their environment, in this case their host galaxies. Our goal is to find correlation between {ULXs} and the properties of its host galaxies, for example with Star Formation Rate ({SFR}), mass and morphology. From this study we found a positive correlation between {ULXs} number and {SFR}. From X-ray luminosity function, we found upper limit of black holes mass that power {ULXs} is about 100 M ⊙ .},

In this paper, we determine the exact values of the size tripartite numbers m3(P3, {mK}1,n) for all integers m ≥ 1 and n ≥ 3, where P3 is a path of order 3 and {mK}1,n is a disjoint union of m copies of a star K1,n.},

The study of the properties of a Halin graph has received much attention. For instances, it has been shown that every Halin graph is 3-connected and Hamiltonian. A Halin graph has also treewidth at most three, so that many graph optimization problems that are {NP}-complete for arbitrary planar graphs may be solved in linear time on Halin graphs using dynamic programming. In this paper, we characterize all Halin graphs with 3,4,5,6, and 7 inner faces and give their locating-chromatic number. Furthermore, we show that there exist a Halin graph having locating-chromatic number k ≥ 4 with r≥max\{3,(k−2)3−(k−2)22+1\} inner faces.},

This research use helium coolant which has low neutron moderation, chemical inert and single phase. This study use natural uranium and plutonium. Plutonium taken from spent fuel of {LWR} (Light Water Reactor). So, it can reduced spent fuel in the world. The calculation use {SRAC}2006 and {JENDL} 4.0 for the data libraries. First, we calculate {PIJ} for fuel pin cell calculation and {CITATION} for core calculation. The reflector radial-axial width is 50 cm. The variation of fuel fraction is 40\% until 65\%, cladding 10\%, and moderator 25\% up to 50\%. The variation of the power is 75-300 {MWth} (25-100 {MWe}). The calculation of survey parameter has been done. The variation of percentage plutonium is 7\% up to 13\%. We have optimum k-eff value in percentage of plutonium 11\%. The high powers cause k-eff value high too. Second, the core configuration divided by three variation fuel (F1, F2, and F3). F1 is located in the central core, F2 middle core and F3 outer core. The variation percentage Plutonium for fuel F1:F2:F3 = 8\%:10\%:12\%. The increasing power level make the burn up level increase. All case can reach burn up time plus than 20 years. The thermal powers increase cause the peak power density increase. The power 150 {MWth}, 225 {MWth}, and 300 {MWth} have excess reactivity (\%Ak/k) less than 2\%.},

	abstract = {A two-four finite difference scheme for Boussinesq equations was developed by Mohapatra and Chaudhry in 2004. This scheme is of course also applicable to solve the shallow water equations. However this scheme is not robust to deal with dry bed, that is, spurious oscillations appear around wet-dry areas. In this paper we propose a modified two-four finite difference scheme to solve the shallow water equations involving (almost) dry bed. The modified scheme has fewer number of divisions by zero or almost zero, and at the same time, only conserved quantities (mass and momentum) are used in the evolution of the new scheme. The modification lies on the discretisation of the momentum equation. We discretise the momentum equation using the momentum variable itself rather than using the velocity variable as done by Mohapatra and Chaudhry. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is more robust for wetting and drying processes of the shallow water equations.},

Data was collected using multiple-choice test consisting of eight questions. The participants were required to give answers along with their reasoning. The test was developed based on the indicators of concept comprehension. The study was conducted to 161 college students enrolled in stereochemistry topic in the odd semester (2014/2015) from two {LPTK} (teacher training institutes) in Bandar Lampung and Gorontalo, and one public university in Bandung. The result indicates that college students’ level of comprehension towards 3D molecule representations and its inter-conversion was 5\% on high level, 22 \% on the moderate level, and 73 \% on the low level. The dominant factors identified as the cause of difficulties to comprehend 3D molecule representation and its interconversion were (i) the lack of spatial awareness, (ii) violation of absolute configuration determination rules, (iii) imprecise placement of observers, (iv) the lack of rotation operation, and (v) the lack of understanding of correlation between the representations. This study recommends that learning show more rigorous spatial awareness training tasks accompanied using dynamic visualization media of molecules associated. Also students learned using static molecular models can help them overcome their difficulties encountered.},

The hydroxyl stretching band in {PVP} shifted to a lower wavenumber with higher intenstity in the presence of curcumin and {PVP}, indicating that hydrogen bond formation is more intense in a curcumin or curcumin–T20 containing fiber. The thermal pattern of the fiber did not indicate phase separation. The conversion of curcumin into an amorphous state was confirmed by {XRD} analysis.

We find that approximate solutions can be written as a linear combination of the Lambert function solutions in all branches. Simulations are presented for three cases of the ratio of the rate of glucose supply to the maximum reaction rate of the enzyme that experienced delay. The simulations are worked out by taking the principal branch of the matrix Lambert function as the most dominant mode. Our present numerical results show that the zeroth mode approach is quite reliable compared to the results given by classical numerical simulations using the Runge-Kutta method.},

The advantages of the present method are that it is simple and relatively fast, and it only needs a small amount of reagents. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray Diffraction ({XRD}), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ({FTIR}), Scanning Electron Microscopy ({SEM}), Transmission Electron Microscopy ({TEM}) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy ({EDX}). From the {XRD} data, the average crystallite size, t, of the Gd2O3@{PEG} nanoparticles was calculated to be about 5.4, 3.8, and 3.1nm at decomposition temperatures of 260°C, 280°C and 300°C respectively. The {SEM} images revealed that the synthesized nanoparticles had a homogenous spherical shape while the coated nanoparticle diameters were about 178nm at 260°C. Synthesis at higher temperatures tended to cause agglomeration. {FTIR} analysis showed that the oxidation of {PEG} is linked to the Gd2O3 surface. Magnetization was investigated using a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer ({VSM}). The magnetization vs. magnetic field (M–H) curve, measured at 300K, showed that the Gd2O3@{PEG} nanoparticles exhibit characteristic paramagnetic behavior. We confirmed that the dispersibility and functionalization behavior of the {PEG} was successfully transferred to the Gd2O3 nanoparticles.},

	abstract = {The repeating unit of sulfonated “nata de coco” is D-glucose sulfonate. This research aims to determine the most stable structures of sulfonated nata de coco polymer membrane, the energy and hydrogen bonds, in order to understand the characteristics, local hydration, and proton transfer on the membrane on the ab initio electronic structure calculation. The minimum energy structure for its monomer (two, three, four and five) are calculated by B3LYP/6-311G (d) method. The calculations show that there is no significant energy change on the structure interaction of two, three, four and five monomer of sulfonated nata de coco with one water molecule, which is about -18.82 kcal/mole. Those calculations that two monomers form of sulfonated nata de coco might be used to further calculation and research, because it can be considered as the representative for their polymer. The optimization and B3LYP/6-311G (d) calculation shows the amount of water molecule used for proton transfer is closely related to the formation of hydrogen bonding with sulfonic group. By the addition of one or two water molecule, the dissociated proton is stabilized by formation of hydronium ion. For further addition of water molecule (three to ten water molecules), the proton dissociation is also stabilized by the formation of Zundel ion and Eigen ion. The calculation of interaction energy with n water molecule (n = 1-10) shows that both energy change (∆E), and enthalpy change (∆H) are more negative. This implies that the interaction with water molecule is stronger. The bonding energy is about 14.0-16.5 kcal/mole per water molecule. On the addition of four and eight water molecules, proton dissociation forms two Zundel ion and two Eigen ions and causes lower bonding energy about 2 kcal/mole. Those optimization and energy calculations conclude that the formation of hydrogen bonding among water molecule and sulfonic group affects proton transfer on sulfonated nata de coco membrane.},

Nanoparticle aggregates-like structures (nanoaggregates) were formed, although a salt precursor was used for the synthesis. The macroporous structure was tailored by changing the mass ratio of the polystyrene template to ammonium tungstate pentahydrate. The cavities between the nanoaggregates formed mesopores, which increased the surface area. The presence of meso- and macro-pores in the synthesized Pt/{WO}3 particles improved their photocatalytic activities in visible-light-induced photodegradation of rhodamine B. The combination of a high surface area and the presence of an in situ-deposited Pt cocatalyst gave a high photodecomposition rate, approximately 9.6 times higher than that achieved with dense {WO}3 particles. This research provides a promising strategy for synthesizing submicron particles with high surface areas at a high production rate, and is suitable for industrial applications. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 62: 3864–3873, 2016},

However, they are significantly suppressed in the {ZnO} film on Pt ({ZOP}). These imply that the interactions of the valence itinerant electrons in Pt with {ZnO} film are responsible for the electronic blocking of electron (e)-hole (h) pairs or excitons. Furthermore, as a function of Cu doping, the screening effects on excitonic states and the new localized interband transition were observed for the {ZOP} and {ZOQ} systems.

	abstract = {The rapidly growing demand for petroleum resources has become a crucial
global problem. Therefore, a more realistic solution is required for oil
production. Enhanced oil recovery ({EOR}) has become an essential technique to
extract original oil content and maintain oil fields. During this process,
certain viscous polymers are commonly used as mobility control agents. In this
work, we introduce a new class of polymer to address the limitations of
commercial {EOR} polymers. We successfully extracted kappa-type carrageenan from Eucheuma
cottonii seaweed using demineralized water and ethanol precipitation. The
amount of yield, intrinsic viscosity, and viscosity-average molecular mass of
the extracted carrageenan were 18.64\%, 12.77 {dLg}-1, and 4.716×105
gmol-1, respectively. Characterizations were done by dynamic
viscosity and rheological measurement, along with a thermal degradation test.
The measurements indicated that kappa-carrageenan
is an attractive green substitute for polyacrylamide, as it showed relatively
high resistance to temperature, shear rate, and salinity compared to
polyacrylamide-based commercial {EOR} polymers. However, a higher concentration 
of carrageenan is still needed to reach the same viscosity as the commercial
polymers.},

We establish the interpolation of generalized weak Morrey spaces, generalized Orlicz–Morrey spaces and generalized weak Orlicz–Morrey spaces. We also consider the closure of the functions which are essentially bounded and have compact support. The second interpolation of such spaces will yield a class of closed spaces; we describe the second interpolation of the closure of the functions which are essentially bounded and have compact support. This result will carry over to generalized Morrey spaces, generalized weak Morrey spaces, generalized Orlicz–Morrey spaces and generalized weak Orlicz–Morrey spaces.

In this research, we carefully examine the morphology of {KCC}-1 to define more appropriate nomenclature. We also propose a formation mechanism of {KCC}-1 based on our experimental evidence. Herein, the {KCC}-1 morphology was interpreted mainly on the basis of compiling all observation and information taken from {SEM} and {TEM} images. Further analysis on {TEM} images was carried out. The gray value intensity profile was derived from {TEM} images in order to determine the specific pattern of this unique morphology that is found to be clearly different from that of other types of porous spherical-like morphologies. On the basis of these results, the {KCC}-1 morphology would be more appropriately reclassified as bicontinuous concentric lamellar morphology. Some physical characteristics such as the origin of emulsion, electrical conductivity, and the local structure of water molecules in the {KCC}-1 emulsion were disclosed to reveal the formation mechanism of {KCC}-1. The origin of the {KCC}-1 emulsion was characterized by the observation of the Tyndall effect, conductometry to determine the critical micelle concentration, and Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the morphological evolution study during {KCC}-1 synthesis completes the portrait of the formation of mesoporous silica {KCC}-1.},

We carried out a series of photometric observations of the Karin family asteroids, and here we report on the analysis of the lightcurves including the rotation period of eleven members. The mean rotation rate of the Karin family members turned out to be much lower than those of near-Earth asteroids or small main belt asteroids (diameter D {\textless} 12 km), and even lower than that of large main belt asteroids (D {\textgreater} 130 km). We investigated a correlation between the peak-to-trough variation and the rotation period of the eleven Karin family asteroids, and found a possible trend that elongated members have lower spin rates, and less elongated members have higher spin rates. However, this trend has to be confirmed by another series of future observations.},

	abstract = {The low-temperature synthesis of zeolite {ZSM}-5 below 100°C is gaining new attention. This is due to the fact that such synthesis may simultaneously implement the introduction of mesopores into crystalline microporous zeolite structure. Herein, we report the use of natural silica precursors from rice husks in the mesoporogen-free synthesis of hierarchical {ZSM}-5 below 100°C and their structural properties which govern the course of crystallization. Rice husks are agricultural wastes with high silica content, which should be exploited to give a positive impact, i.e. highly value-added materials. In this study, the amorphous silica from rice husks was extracted using sequential base-acid treatment. The extracted silica was similarly reactive as Ludox {HS}-40, even with the reduced amounts of the organic structure-directing agent ({OSDA}). The product was highly crystalline {ZSM}-5 with spherical morphology composed of small crystallites, enabling the presence of intercrystallite mesopores. The subjection of extracted silica into the calcination at 550°C for 6h, prior to the low-temperature synthesis, altered the silica structure via hydroxyl condensation. The distinct structural properties affected the occurring crystallization in which the resulted products were {ZSM}-5–disordered-mesoporous silica composites. The possible mechanisms of these two different results may involve the dual roles of tetrapropylammonium ion ({TPA}+) as zeolite {OSDA} and non-templating structure directing agent. These insights were based on the spectroscopic ({FTIR}, Raman, 29Si and 27Al {MAS} {NMR} spectroscopy), microscopic ({TEM} and {HRTEM}) and physicochemical characterizations ({XRD} and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm).},

Generation of hierarchically porous {ZSM}-5 with micro and mesopores has been a rational solution for overcoming this problem. The conventional method for synthesizing hierarchically porous {ZSM}-5 generally requires high-temperature heating in the presence of an organic structure-directing agent ({OSDA}) and a mesopore-generating agent (mesoporogen). Herein, we report a new method for the synthesis of hierarchically porous {ZSM}-5, which leads to the synthesis at low temperature in the presence of a reduced amount of {OSDA} and in the absence of any mesoporogen. The {OSDA} seems to play an additional role as a scaffolding agent for mesopore generation. Our study also showed that the control of the molar composition is essential for the crystallization of hierarchically porous-{ZSM}-5.},

However, few studies have investigated enhancements of the {ON}/{OFF} current ratio as a function of the electron spin behavior. Here, we found a significantly high spin-dependent current ratio—more than 102 at 1.5 V—when changing the relative direction of the magnetizations between {FePt} nanodots ({NDs}) and the {CoPtCr}-coated atomic force microscope ({AFM}) probe at room temperature. This means that {ON} and {OFF} states were achieved by switching the magnetization of the {FePt} {NDs}, which can be regarded as spin-diodes. The {FePt} magnetic {NDs} were fabricated by exposing a bi-layer metal stack to a remote H2 plasma (H2-{RP}) on {\textasciitilde}1.7 nm {SiO}2/Si(100) substrates. The ultrathin bi-layers with a uniform surface coverage are changed drastically to {NDs} with an areal density as high as {\textasciitilde}5 × 1011 cm−2. The {FePt} {NDs} exhibit a large perpendicular anisotropy with an out-of-plane coercivity of {\textasciitilde}4.8 {kOe}, reflecting the magneto-crystalline anisotropy of (001) oriented L10 phase {FePt}. We also designed and fabricated double-stacked {FePt}-{NDs} with low and high coercivities sandwiched between an ultra-thin Si-oxide interlayer, and confirmed a high {ON}/{OFF} current ratio when switching the relative magnetization directions of the low and high coercivity {FePt} {NDs}.},

	abstract = {The absence of organic structure directing agent ({OSDA}) in the synthesis of zeolite has shown progress recently, nevertheless the formation mechanism is still not clearly understood and the technique cannot be fully generalized for the synthesis of various types of zeolite frameworks. In this research, the drastic reduction of {OSDA} in the synthesis of {ZSM}-5 employing the steam-assisted crystallization ({SAC}) was studied. The used tetrapropylammonium bromide as {OSDA} in the synthesis of {ZSM}-5 was one-fifth and one-twentieth of typical amount reported in literature. Upon {OSDA} reduction, the crystallization leads to the formation of {ZSM}-5 with hierarchical pore structure revealed by {SEM} and {TEM} images in which it is different compared to the parent spherical-like crystal morphology of {ZSM}-5 synthesized without reducing the {OSDA} amounts. A quantitative analysis of the X-ray diffractograms suggests that 100\% crystallinity could not be achieved in the sample synthesized under the {OSDA} reduction confirming that the orientation of crystal growth is not similar to the conventional coffin-type {ZSM}-5 crystal. The deviancy in crystal growth is further associated with the formation of mesopores originated from severe defect planes of {ZSM}-5. On the verge of gradual disappearance, a broadened distribution of mesoporosity could return the crystallinity to 100\% in which faulty elongated crystal shape, close to typical coffin-type growth orientation appeared as the product after commencing the Oswald ripening of longer period of synthesis time. The conventional hydrothermal synthesis may not be used for crystallizing {ZSM}-5 when the {OSDA} was one-twentieth of typical starting amount making the {SAC} to be an appropriate technique for synthesizing {ZSM}-5 under drastically reduced {OSDA}, in particular to simultaneously perform the hierarchically porous zeolite.},

	abstract = {The mesoporous silica structure ({MSN}) was synthesized using the sol–gel method followed by aluminum grafting and protonation and was then denoted as {HAlMSN} (Si/Al = 18.9). N2 physisorption confirmed the mesoporous structure with a pore diameter of 3.38 nm. 27Al {NMR} showed the presence of framework and extra-framework aluminum structures, which led to the formation of strong Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites. {HAlMSN} catalyzed the synthesis of (E)-chalcones through the Claisen–Schmidt reaction. Chalcone derivatives have been applied as biologically active compounds with anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and diuretic pharmacological activities. The products were obtained via reactions on the protonic acid sites of {HAlMSN}. The significant advantages of this reaction are high yield, easy work up, short reaction time and also compatibility with various organic solvents. The products were obtained in an excellent conversion of 97\% at 298 K. The results show that the electron donating substituents exhibit higher conversion in comparison to electron withdrawing substituents. The stability of the catalyst was investigated by reusing it five times for (E)-chalcone production and there was only a slight decrease in its catalytic activity. The highest product of (E)-chalcone was observed with a 1 : 2 molar ratio of benzaldehyde/acetophenone. A comparative study in chalcone synthesis using the heterogeneous catalysts demonstrated that {HAlMSN} has a significantly high activity at low temperature.},

A pneumatic linear bearing is used in order to realize linear motion with sufficiently small friction acting on the mass, i.e., the moving part of the bearing. Using this method, the dynamic characteristics of the force sensor are evaluated in detail: small and various-duration impact forces with maximum values of approximately 0.4-6.0 N and full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) of approximately 0.6-2.8 ms are applied to the force sensor and the impact responses of the force sensor are evaluated.},

Here, the kinetics of nitrogen-doped {CD} (N-{CD}) formation by hydrothermal synthesis were evaluated in an attempt to realize the rapid and efficient production of N-{CDs}. A series of N-{CDs} was synthesized using various heating rates, reaction times, reaction temperatures, and precursor concentrations. Characterization of the series of N-{CDs} indicated that N-{CD} formation is a first-order reaction with a reaction rate constant of 0.634 min−1. In addition, systematic investigation revealed that synthesis temperature is a more important factor to obtain highly fluorescent N-{CDs} than reaction time. Citric acid amides are formed by the reaction between citric acid and urea at 130 °C and N-{CDs} consisting of two or three citric acid amide molecules are formed through dehydration, deammoniation and dehydrogenation of citric acid at 150 °C. By adjusting the operating conditions, N-{CDs} with a highest quantum yield of 39.7\% could be produced at a production rate of 50 g h−1 with a reaction time of 16 min. The N-{CDs} were then embedded in polyvinyl alcohol ({PVA}) nanofibers. The luminescence intensity of the N-{CD}–{PVA} composite nanofibers was more than twice that of the N-{CDs} in solution.},

	abstract = {Fragmentation and fission of giant molecular clouds occasionally results in a pair of gravitationally bound star clusters that orbit their mutual centre of mass for some time, under the influence of internal and external perturbations. We investigate the evolution of binary star clusters with different orbital configurations, with a particular focus on the Galactic tidal field. We carry out N-body simulations of evolving binary star clusters and compare our results with estimates from our semi-analytic model. The latter accounts for mass-loss due to stellar evolution and two-body relaxation, and for evolution due to external tides. Using the semi-analytic model, we predict the long-term evolution for a wide range of initial conditions. It accurately describes the global evolution of such systems, until the moment when a cluster merger is imminent. N-body simulations are used to test our semi-analytic model and also to study additional features of evolving binary clusters, such as the kinematics of stars, global cluster rotation, evaporation rates, and the cluster merger process. We find that the initial orientation of a binary star cluster with respect to the Galactic field, and also the initial orbital phase, is crucial for its fate. Depending on these properties, the binaries may experience orbital reversal, spiral-in, or vertical oscillation about the Galactic plane before they actually merge at t ≈ 100 Myr, and produce rotating star clusters with slightly higher evaporation rates. The merger process of a binary cluster induces an outburst that ejects ∼10 per cent of the stellar members into the Galactic field.},

Additionally, we observed that a model of a solar cell made using a composite of {TiO}2 and graphite as the active material had much higher efficiency than solar cells made using {TiO}2- or graphite-only active materials. Although the highest efficiency we report here is approximately 1 \%, our proposed solar cell structure is promising for mass application, especially in low-income settings, owing to its easy and flexible fabrication, and easy large-scale application.},

	abstract = {Studies pertaining to heat flow density distribution in Indonesian tertiary sedimentary basins have been conducted intermittently throughout more than two decades. Even so, all of these studies have always concentrated on the basic compilations of thermal gradient, thermal conductivity, and terrestrial heat flow datasets or the study of basin thermal history rather than on the investigations into their present thermal regime. In addition, syntheses on the possible causes to the observed heat flow density distribution in these basins have been largely determined only on the basis of its correlation with geological and geophysical evidences. One basin experiencing this particular problem is the onshore Northwest Java Basin, where knowledge of the present-day subsurface temperature structure is virtually absent and interpretation of heat flow distribution has been mainly qualitative. For these reasons, in this study we have attempted to quantitatively characterize the present subsurface temperature distribution and surface heat flow density of the onshore Northwest Java Basin using a simple numerical thermal modeling approach, based on the most recent heat flow datasets. Taking into account a conductive heat transfer process, the modeling exercise is aimed at deriving a 3-D subsurface temperature distribution. The temperature distribution is translated into the predicted surface heat flow distribution. The modeled temperature field reveals its dependence on the geometrical aspects of the basin’s basement. Comparison between the computed and the observed heat flow densities, taking into account the uncertainties of both, suggests that advective heat transport by groundwater flow may be present, in addition to conduction. The modeling results are thus capable of demonstrating the importance of a quantitative approach in studying the present thermal state of a sedimentary basin.},

	abstract = {Remazol Red B is a reactive dye that is often used in the textile industry. The dye can cause serious problems in the environmental / water because it is difficult to be degraded by microorganisms. Decolorization of reactive azo dyes (Remazol Red B) before being discharged into the environment is an important aspect in creating technology (method) that are environmentally friendly. The method chosen for this decolorization is Advanced Oxidation Process ({AOP}) using the Fenton reaction. The optimum conditions for this reaction is 25 mg/L H2O2 and 1.25 mg/L of Fe2+ to Remazol Red B with initial concentration at 83 mg/L ( with ratio [H2O2]/[Fe2+] = 20). The optimum conditions of this reaction were obtained at {pH} 3 and temperature of 27 0C, with decolorization efficiency up to 100\% for a reaction time of 60 minutes. The kinetic model of dye decoloritation follow the second order reaction. Some of the metal ions were added i.e. Cu2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ , given no significant impact on the degradation performed.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundNowadays}, biodiesel has become more attractive in the quest for a novel fuel source due to its environmental benefits and the biodegradable properties. Transesterification of Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seeds oil is one of methodsacci for producing biodiesel fuel. However, during this process, the impurities are frequently found in the synthesized biodiesel which degrades the quality of biodiesel. Therefore, a proper catalyst is required to obtain the high-quality biodiesel. In this study, a series of aminated polyethersulfone ({PES}-{\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{{NH}\}\_2{\textbackslash})) membranes was prepared as solid support for immobilized Mucor miehei lipase. Glutaraldehyde was used as a cross-linker agent in immobilization process to investigate the effect of spacer toward biodiesel production.{ResultsBased} on elemental analysis, lipase was successfully attached onto {PES}-{\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{{NH}\}\_2{\textbackslash}) membranes and formed physical interactions. Enzyme loading values of synthesized membrane were higher than that of commercial filtration membrane. {LC}-{MS} analysis with C18 as a column showed that butyl palmitate, butyl linoleate, and butyl oleate were produced from transesterification reaction of triglyceride from sunflower oil and butanol. Based on {FTIR} analysis, the imine group as a covalent bond was successfully obtained during the cross-linking reaction. After reaction with the spacer, the enzyme loading was increased significantly from 177.05 to 911.48 μg/cm{\textbackslash}({\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}). The alkyl esters produced also showed high values after the cross-linking. According to biodiesel quality tests, the results were matched with the values specified by the {ASTM}.{ConclusionBiodiesel} from sunflower seeds oil was successfully synthesized through a transesterification reaction catalyzed by Mucor miehei lipase immobilized onto the synthesized aminated {PES} membrane. The addition of glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker showed an excellent enzyme loading value and led to significantly increased biodiesel conversion efficiency. This method is good to be developed, since the immobilized enzyme stability could be increased, the separation process was easier, and a high yield with good quality of biodiesel could be obtained.Open image in new {windowGraphical} {abstractThe} synthesis of biodiesel catalyzed by Mucor miehei lipase immobilized onto aminated polyethersulfone membranes.},

	abstract = {The Bojongsoang Wastewater Treatment Plant ({WWTP}) serves to treat domestic wastewater originating from Bandung City, West Java, Indonesia. An abundant amount of nutrients as a result of waste decomposition increases the number of microalgae populations present in the pond of the wastewater treatment plant, thereby causing a population explosion of microalgae, also called algal blooming. In a stabilization pond system, the presence of algal blooming is not desirable because it can decrease wastewater treatment performance. More knowledge about the relationship between the nutrients concentration and algae blooming conditions, such as microalgae diversity, is needed to control and maintain the performance of the wastewater treatment plant. Therefore this study was conducted, in order to reveal the diversity of microalgae in the stabilization pond system and its relationship with the water characteristics of the comprising ponds. The results showed that the water quality in the stabilization pond system of Bojongsoang {WWTP} supported rapid growth of microalgae, where most rapid microbial growth occurred in the anaerobic pond. The microalgae diversity in the stabilization ponds was very high, with various morphologies, probably affiliated with blue-green algae, green algae, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates and diatoms. This study has successfully produced information on microalgae diversity and abundance profiles in a stabilization pond system.},

The adsorption isotherms were better fitted by Langmuir isotherm with the adsorption capacity was found to be 44.84mg/g. The results of the kinetic study showed that the adsorption of {HA} onto Fe3O4-chitosan hybrid nano-particles could be described by the pseudo second order kinetic model with a rate constant in the range of 0.032–0.104gmg−1min−1, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters data indicated that the {HA} adsorption process was non spontaneous and endothermic under the experimental conditions, with the values of Gibbs free energy (ΔGo) were in the range of 2.92–4.65kJ/mol; as well as the values of enthalpy (ΔHo), entropy (ΔSo) and the activation energy (Ea) were found to be 21.80kJ/mol, 57.55J/mol and 19.27kJ/mol, respectively. The computational chemistry study showed that the interaction between adsorbent and {HA} was occurred through the interaction between amine groups of chitosan and phenol groups of {HA}. The adsorption of {HA} from real sample using the prepared adsorbents showed that the Fe3O4-chitosan hybrid nano-particles has higher adsorption percentages than both Fe3O4 nano-particles and pure chitosan.},

The oligomer was tested as corrosion inhibitor of mild steel in brine solution saturated with carbon dioxide, with the main purpose to investigate the effect of inhibitor concentrations and temperatures on the inhibition activity defined in terms of corrosion rate and percent of protection. The inhibition tests were carried out using the methods of weight loss ({WL}) and linear polarization ({LP}). Characterization using {MALDI}-{TOF} {MS} revealed that the oligomer has the mass (m/z) in the range 200-2400, which corresponds to chain length of 2-22 repeating units. The results of corrosion rate measurements show that the corrosion rate with the use of oligomer is significantly lower than that without inhibitor, demonstrating that the oligomer functioned as effective corrosion inhibitor, while the 4-vinyl pyridine monomer was found to promote the corrosion. It was also found that the protection by the oligomer increased with increasing temperature and it was predicted the oligomer was chemically adsorbed by the surface of the metal.},

	abstract = {We study the effect of density distribution evolution on the global one-armed oscillation modes in low-viscosity discs around isolated and binary Be stars. Observations show that some Be stars exhibit evidence of formation and dissipation of the equatorial disc. In this paper, we first calculate the density evolution in discs around isolated Be stars. To model the formation stage of the disc, we inject mass at a radius just outside the star at a constant rate for 30–50 yr. As the disc develops, the density distribution approaches the form of the steady disc solution. Then, we turn-off the mass injection to model the disc dissipation stage. The innermost part of the disc starts accretion, and a gap forms between the star and the disc. Next, we calculate the one-armed modes at several epochs. We neglect the effect of viscosity because the time-scale of oscillations is much shorter than the disc evolution time-scale for low viscosity. In the disc formation stage, the eigenfrequency increases with time towards the value for the steady state disc. On the other hand, one-armed eigenmodes in dissipating Be discs have significantly higher eigenfrequencies and narrower propagation regions. Observationally, such a change of mode characteristics can be taken as an evidence for gap opening around the star. In binary Be stars, the characteristics of the disc evolution and the eigenmodes are qualitatively the same as in isolated Be stars, but quantitatively, they have shorter evolution time-scales and higher eigenfrequencies, which is in agreement with the observed trend.},

This study is performed in terms of the photonic local density of states ({LDOS}) calculated using the Green tensor method, in order to elucidate those combined effects. The energy profiles of {LDOS} inside the dielectric core are shown to exhibit consistently growing number of redshifted photonic states due to an enhanced plasmon coupling induced state mixing arising from decreased shell thickness, increased cavity size effect, and larger symmetry breaking effect induced by increased permittivity difference between the core and the background media. Further, an increase in cavity size leads to increased additional peaks that spread out toward the lower energy regime. A systematic analysis of those variations for a silver nanoshell with a fixed inner radius in vacuum background reveals a certain pattern of those growing number of redshifted states with an analytic expression for the corresponding energy downshifts, signifying a photonic state mixing scheme beyond the commonly adopted plasmon hybridization scheme. Finally, a remarkable correlation is demonstrated between the {LDOS} energy profiles outside the shell and the corresponding scattering efficiencies.},

Raman spectra of {HoVO} 3 and {YVO} 3 unveil similar features since both compounds have nearly identical R-radii. However, the most important difference lies in the transition temperature involving the V 3+ orbitals, the V 3+ magnetic moments as well as the crystallographic structure. Particularly, the magnetic and orbital reorientations occur at T N 2 = 40 K for {HoVO} 3 instead T N 2 =77 K in the case of {YVO} 3 . For both systems, anomalous phonon shifts which are related to spin-phonon coupling are observed below the V 3+ magnetic ordering temperature ( T N 1 ≈ 110 K) while additional phonon anomalies are exclusively observed in {HoVO} 3 around T * ≈ 15 K. On the other hand, infrared ({IR}) transmittance measurements as a function of temperature reveal Ho 3+5 I 8 → 5 I 7 excitations and additional excitations assigned as vibronics. These latter combined with drastic changes in Ho 3+5 I 8 → 5 I 7 excitations at T N 2 , are indicative of a strong coupling between the Ho 3+ ions and the ligand field. This could explain the large magnetocaloric capacity shown by {HoVO} 3 .},

The physical parameters such as polaron radius, field strength and inter nuclear distance have been determined from measurements of densities and refractive indices. The structural properties of the prepared borate glasses were analyzed based on X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) and {FTIR} instruments. The diffraction spectra show no characteristic peaks in these glasses, which indicates the amorphous nature of the glasses. The infrared spectrum of the Eu3+-doped sodium-lead-zinc-lithium-borate glass systems show three disparate regions for active absorption band around 830–860 cm−1, 1020–1040 cm−1 and 1170–1180 cm−1. The electronic transitions in the {UV}–vis and {NIR} regions are assigned to the 7F0 → 5D4, 7F0 → 5G2, 7F0 → 5L6, 7F0 → 5D3, 7F0 → 5D2, 7F0 → 5D1, 7F0 → 5D0 7F1 → 5D0 7F0 → 7F6 and 7F1 → 7F6 levels centered at 362 nm, 380 nm, 395 nm, 414 nm, 465 nm, 533 nm, 583 nm, 590 nm 2092 nm and 2202 nm respectively. Five transition bands of luminescence spectra have been observed by using an excited wavelength of 395 nm. The luminescence intensity ratio (R) of 5D0 → 7F2 (electric dipole) transition to 5D0 → 7F1 (magnetic dipole) transition has been determined to obtain the strength of the covalent/ionic bond between the Eu3+ ions and the surrounding ligands. Radiative life time and emission color of the glasses were estimated and compared with other literature data by varying Eu3+ concentrations. The experimental lifetime of the 5D0 level was found to increase with increasing Eu3+ ion content, suggesting higher non-radiative energy transfer among Eu3+ ions in the glasses.},

In the model, there is no inflaton potential, but the inflaton couples to the Guass-Bonnet term. In the case of quadratic coupling, they find inflation occurs with a graceful exit. The scenario is attractive because of the natural setup. However, we show there exists a gradient instability in the tensor perturbations in this inflationary model.

The coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction ({XRD}), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS}), {UV}-Vis-{NIR} spectrophotometry, and nanoindentation. The {XRD} analysis in 2θ-range of 30°–42° revealed that the coatings exhibited low crystallinity of {CoCu}2O3, {CoCuO}2, and {CuCoO}2. The surface bonding structure analyzed using {XPS} indicated that the coating contained: Cu (tetrahedral Cu+ and octahedral Cu2+), Co (octahedral Co3+, tetrahedral Co2+, and mixed Co2+ and Co3+), and O (lattice, surface, and sub-surface oxygens).
The optical properties characterized using {UV}-Vis-{NIR} showed that the reflectance spectra of coatings formed a spectrally solar selective absorber profile associated with the interference peaks and the absorption edges around wavelengths of below 1.2 μm. The maximum absorptance (α = 75.8\%) was shown by coating synthesized at 500 °C. The mechanical properties of coatings showed that the increase of annealing temperature increased the coating's hardness (H) and the elastic modulus (E) due to the enhancement of the [{CoCuO}2/{CuCoO}2]:[{CoCu}2O3] oxide phases ratio, as the result, an excellent stability of the wear resistance (H/E) of around ∼0.035 was recorded.},

	abstract = {Design study on heavy water cooled thorium breeding reactor has been investigated by adopting a nuclear equilibrium state model. Conversion ratio, as an important index, has been evaluated to estimate the breeding capability of the reactors. Void reactivity coefficient has also been investigated to evaluate performance index of safety aspect, which is based on the criticality performance of the reactors during voided condition. In addition, moderator-to-fuel ratio has also been employed to analyze its effect to the required enrichment, conversion ratio, and void reactivity coefficient as well as different burnups and fuel pin diameter effects. Void reactivity coefficient indicates a criticality condition of the reactor when some coolants are lost. If the negative value of void reactivity is achieved, it means that the reactor has less reactivity condition as well as less power production when lost of coolant occurred. Higher fuel conversion capability, that more nuclear fuel are produced, those additional fuel productions can be used for next operation or for other reactors. The results show that higher fuel conversion ratio can be achieved for less moderator-to-fuel ratio because of the harder neutron spectrum effect, while it requires more fissile content of 233U to maintain the reactor operation from fission reaction. Higher burnup gives less conversion ratio because some fissile materials are used to maintain longer reactor operation, and at the same time, it requires more initial required fissile 233U for higher burnup. In addition, it requires less fissile 233U for thicker fuel pin diameter, while its conversion ratio becomes higher, and void reactivity coefficient is more negative for thicker fuel pin diameter. The results also show that thorium utilization on heavy water cooled reactor gives all negative void reactivity values, which means that the system has a safety condition in terms of void reactivity condition. At the same time, it shows some feasible conditions for obtaining fuel breeding to increase the sustainability of nuclear fuel. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	url = {One application of composite materials is for use as building walls. One characteristic of building walls is they can absorb acoustic waves. Buildings near crowded streets perhaps need the walls which absorb sound better than other areas. This paper presents the calculation of acoustic transmission of 1-D composite model containing two component materials. In general, the wave intensity decreases when it comes to boundary surface of different media, and attenuated during propagation in a medium. The acoustic impedance and attenuation coefficient data used are referred to wood and epoxy. To study the influence of physical properties on the acoustic transmission of the 1-D composites, the output acoustic intensities are calculated for several conditions: different total thicknesses for a pair of wood – epoxy, different fractions of wood (17-58)% for a pair of wood - epoxy, and two different thicknesses: 0.8 cm and 0.4 cm of components for the arrangement of one pair and two pairs of wood – epoxy (50:50), respectively, for the same total thickness.

	abstract = {One application of composite materials is for use as building walls. One characteristic of building walls is they can absorb acoustic waves. Buildings near crowded streets perhaps need the walls which absorb sound better than other areas. This paper presents the calculation of acoustic transmission of 1-D composite model containing two component materials. In general, the wave intensity decreases when it comes to boundary surface of different media, and attenuated during propagation in a medium. The acoustic impedance and attenuation coefficient data used are referred to wood and epoxy. To study the influence of physical properties on the acoustic transmission of the 1-D composites, the output acoustic intensities are calculated for several conditions: different total thicknesses for a pair of wood – epoxy, different fractions of wood (17-58)\% for a pair of wood - epoxy, and two different thicknesses: 0.8 cm and 0.4 cm of components for the arrangement of one pair and two pairs of wood – epoxy (50:50), respectively, for the same total thickness. The acoustic transmissions are calculated for incident acoustic intensity of heavy traffic, i.e. 80 {dB} (10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} watt/m{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}). The results show that the output acoustic intensity of the composite model is lower than that of wood and epoxy. The output acoustic intensity decreases as wood fraction increases.

In this study the preliminary analysis of start-up process of modified {CANDLE} burn-up scheme based long life Pb-Bi Cooled Fast Reactors has been performed. The basic strategy is to put different plutonium content in each core regions by considering its equilibrium plutonium content in each region. The system then is started as a Modified {CANDLE} reactor system until relatively stable cycle obtained. The calculation has been done by using {SLAROM}, {SRAC}, and {FI}-{ITB} {CH}1 system codes. Two dimensional multi-group diffusion and burn-up calculation has been adopted during simulation. As results, the start-up scheme of several Modified {CANDLE} core with power level of 1150-1350 {MWt} have been performed. In this case {LWR} plutonium is used to initiate the {MCANDLE} reactors.

Many research has been conducted to examine feasibility of thorium fuel. In this present study, burnable poison feasibility on combined thorium-uranium based fuel for long life {PWR} at thermal power output 800 {MWt} has been conducted. Fuel of this reactor design has implemented {ThO}2 combined by 40 – 60\% enriched {UO}2 in an acceptable enrichment (13-20 \% U-235). To reach long life operation time, fuel volume fraction examination varied for 40-60 \%.

Gd2O3 has very high thermal neutron absorption cross section, small amount of relatively sufficient to reduce excess reactivity, but the effect of this material only work in early burnup step. Np-237 has 190 barns thermal neutron capture cross section which can be used to minimize excess reactivity. Pa-231 has higher thermal neutron capture cross section (280 barns) rather than Np-237 (190 barns), hence the effect of Pa-231 stronger than Np-237 for minimize excess reactivity. In the other side, Pa-231 could compensate fissile isotope in the further burnup step. The optimized design of this study reached 10 years operation time with excess reactivity smaller than 2.5\% dk/k.},

However, the role of the attenuation due to the patient table in these estimations requires careful consideration and is the subject of this study. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of a minimal part of the patient table when calculating the {DW} and {SSDE}. We investigated 164 patients who had undergone {CT} examinations for the pelvis, abdomen, thorax and head. We subsequently calculated {DW} and {SSDE} using two methods: one using a small circular region of interest ({ROI}) including a minimal part of the patient table and the other using a {ROI} fitted to the patient border alone. The results showed that the water equivalent diameter calculated with the table included in the {ROI} ({DW},t) is greater, compared to that without the consideration of the patient table ({DW},nt), by 1.5–6.2\% depending on the anatomy being imaged. On the other hand, the {SSDE} calculated with inclusion of the patient table ({SSDEt}) is smaller than otherwise ({SSDEnt}) by 1.0–5.5\% again depending on the anatomy being imaged. The effect of the patient table on {DW} and {SSDE} in the thorax {CT} examination was statistically significant, but its effect on {DW} and {SSDE} in the other examinations of head, pelvis and abdomen was relatively small and not statistically significant.},

The region of interest on the range image was extracted by using a template matching technique, and the range image was processed for reducing temporal and spatial noise. Next, a mathematical smooth surface of the patient was reconstructed from the range image by using a non-uniform rational B-splines model. The feature points were detected based on curvature features computed on the reconstructed surface. The framework was tested on range images acquired by a time-of-flight ({TOF}) camera and a Kinect sensor for two surface (texture) types of head phantoms A and B that had different anatomical geometries. The detection accuracy was evaluated by measuring the residual error, i.e., the mean of minimum Euclidean distances ({MMED}) between reference (ground truth) and detected feature points on convex and concave regions.{ResultsThe} {MMEDs} obtained using convex feature points for range images of the translated and rotated phantom A were 1.79±0.531.79±0.531.79 {\textbackslash}pm 0.53 and 1.97±0.21mm1.97±0.21mm1.97{\textbackslash}pm 0.21{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}hbox \{mm\}, respectively, using the {TOF} camera.

In this study, {DW} was calculated for standard {CTDI} phantoms and patient images. Two types of phantom were used, one representing the head with a diameter of 16 cm and the other representing the body with a diameter of 32 cm. Images of 63 patients were also taken, 32 who had undergone a {CT} head examination and 31 who had undergone a {CT} thorax examination. There are three main parts to our algorithm for automated {DW} calculation. The first part is to read 3D images and convert the {CT} data into Hounsfield units ({HU}). The second part is to find the contour of the phantoms or patients automatically. And the third part is to automate the calculation of {DW} based on the automated contouring for every slice ({DW},all). The results of this study show that the automated calculation of {DW} and the manual calculation are in good agreement for phantoms and patients. The differences between the automated calculation of {DW} and the manual calculation are less than 0.5\%. The results of this study also show that the estimating of {DW},all using {DW},n=1 (central slice along longitudinal axis) produces percentage differences of −0.92\%±3.37\% and 6.75\%±1.92\%, and estimating {DW},all using {DW},n=9 produces percentage differences of 0.23\%±0.16\% and 0.87\%±0.36\%, for thorax and head examinations, respectively.

Selectivity can be achieved by selection of starting material, selection of hydrolysis conditions, and separation of achieved hydrolysate. Several protease combinations were applied for hydrolysis of rubber seed protein concentrate, wheat gluten, and bovine serum albumin ({BSA}). High degree of hydrolysis ({\textgreater}50 \%) could be achieved. Hydrophobic selectivity was influenced by the combination of proteases and by the extent of hydrolysis. Combination of Pronase and Peptidase R showed the highest selectivity towards hydrophobic amino acids, roughly doubling the content of hydrophobic amino acids in the products compared to the original substrates. Hydrophobic selectivity of 0.6 mol-hydrophobic/mol-total free amino acids was observed after 6 h hydrolysis of wheat gluten and 24 h hydrolysis of rubber seed proteins and {BSA}. The results of experiments with rubber seed proteins and wheat gluten suggest that this process can be applied to agro-industrial residues.},

	abstract = {Big bang theory states that universe emerged from singularity with very high temperature and density, then expands homogeneously and isotropically. This theory gives rise standard cosmological principle which declares that universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. However, universe is not perfectly homogeneous and isotropic on small scales. There exist structures starting from clusters, galaxies even to stars and planetary system scales. Cosmological perturbation theory is a fundamental theory that explains the origin of structures. According to this theory, the structures can be regarded as small perturbations in the early universe, which evolves as the universe expands. In addition to the problem of inhomogeneities of the universe, observations of supernovae Ia suggest that our universe is being accelerated. Various models of dark energy have been proposed to explain cosmic acceleration, one of them is cosmological constant. Because of several problems arise from cosmological constant, the alternative models have been proposed, one of these models is quintessence. We reconstruct growth of structure model following quintessence scenario at several epochs of the universe, which is specified by the effective equation of state parameters for each stage. Discussion begins with the dynamics of quintessence, in which exponential potential is analytically derived, which leads to various conditions of the universe. We then focus on scaling and quintessence dominated solutions. Subsequently, we review the basics of cosmological perturbation theory and derive formulas to investigate how matter perturbation evolves with time in subhorizon scales which leads to structure formation, and also analyze the influence of quintessence to the structure formation. From analytical exploration, we obtain the growth rate of matter perturbation and the existence of quintessence as a dark energy that slows down the growth of structure formation of the universe.},

A model of Binary Supermassive Black Holes ({SMBHs}) in the center of {OJ} 287 is used to explain the phenomenon of 12-year periodic outbursts. Multiwavelength observations confirm outbursts of {OJ} 287 in several bands, one of them is in the X-ray band. X-ray spectra of {OJ} 287 from X-ray observations in 2005 to 2016 were analyzed to determine the variability in X-ray. Spectral data were obtained from X-ray Imaging Spectrometers ({XIS}) from Suzaku mission and X-ray Telescope ({XRT}) mission from Swift. Energy intervals of the X-ray spectra are 0.4 – 10 {keV} for Suzaku/{XIS} and 0.3 – 7 {keV} for Swift/{XRT}. The data were divided into several non-outburst and outburst data groups. In general, power law model is considered the most appropriate model and it is also confirmed that the X-ray spectra of {OJ} 287 during that period exhibit fluctuation in photon index value, Γ. Variability of the value of Γ indicates that there is evolution of the X-ray spectra of {OJ} 287 during the non-outburst phase and also during the transitions between non-outburst and outburst phase and vice versa. Different values of Γ are also found during different outburst phases. In general, the derived values of Γ are in agreement with the inverse Compton process (Γ ∼1 – 2), in contrast with the synchrotron process (Γ ∼2 – 3). We also found that Γ increases as the flux increases, as opposed to synchrotron process. In addition, X-ray luminosity of {OJ} 287 shows fluctuation within {\textasciitilde}1011 ≤ L⊙ ≤ 1012. The X-ray light curve was made and compared with an optical light curve to investigate the correlation of outbursts time in both bands.},

However, high temperature corrosion when contact with stainless steels is one of the issues of Pb-Bi eutectic utilization. It is known that in the environment of high temperature Pb-Bi, mechanical strength of stainless steel may decrease. Thus, simulation of mechanical stress working on stainless steel during in-situ bending test by using {ABAQUS} was conducted. Several bending degrees were simulated at high temperature to obtain the mechanical stress information. Temperature condition was strongly affect the stress vs. displacement profile. The reported mechanical strength reduction percentage was used to draw predicted mechanical stress under high temperature Pb-Bi environment.},

Bandgap of strained {AGNR} estimated by an extended tight binding method is applied to obtain electrical characteristics of a {TFET} under the quantum capacitance limit device approximation. Furthermore, the electron transmittance is calculated by utilizing the {WKB} (Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin) approach. The obtained transmittance is then used to calculate the drain current by employing the Landauer formula. The results show that strain parameter has significant effect on the current. In other words, the electrical characteristics of {AGNR} {TFET} can be tuned by the strain of {AGNR}.},

Bellows-sealed valve is a crucial part in the {LBE} loop test apparatus, due to its capability of preventing corrosion on valve spring, thus improves the operation time of the system. {LBE} is very corrosive to stainless steel by formation of oxide layer or elemental dissolution, e.g. Ni. Thus, new type of bellows for bellows-sealed valve made of nickel free material, i.e. {YUS}409D, is proposed to be used in the {LBE}. Bellows material undergo heat treatments for mechanical improvement including cold working and annealing. The thickness reduction by the heat treatments is about 90\% of initial condition. Corrosion behavior of the bellows has been studied in stagnant {LBE} at 500 and 600 °C for 500 hours. The oxygen concentration was controlled at about 10 −7 wt\%. Typical oxide layers were developed on the surface. Oxidation rate was sharply increased at 600°C.},

Here, the purpose of this study was to develop a method for detecting porphyrin concentration using the assistance of giant magnetoresistance. In short of the method, we added Fe 3+ solution to the porphyrin, and the mixed solution was introduced to the magnetic field. Next, the magnetized solution was introduced to the magnetic sensor to indicate the existence of porphyrin in the solution. To confirm the effectiveness of our method in detecting porphyrin, we varied the flow rate and concentration of Fe 3+ -modified porphyrin solution. The result showed that the more concentration and the slower flow rate affected the higher sensitivity gained. Since this developed method is simple but effective for detecting porphyrin concentration, we believe that further development of this method will be benefit for many applications, specifically relating to the medical uses.},

The effect of A -site cation to the local structure of perovskite block was identified by the phonon mode near 750 and 870 cm −1 arising from B O 6 stretching. A -site Ba 2+ , having the largest ionic radius among the considered elements, significantly stiffens the {TiO} 6 octahedra, as derived from the fact that the {TiO} 6 stretching modes have the highest wavenumber for {BaBi} 4 Ti 4 O 15 , i.e. the Ti-O bond strength is strongest for this compound. The replacement of Ti 4+ by Mn 3+ cation at the B - site also influences the B -O bond. The comparison of the phonon modes near 700 and 870 cm −1 in Pb 1− x Bi 4+ x Ti 4− x Mn x O 15 with x = 0, 0.2, and 0.4 shows that the lowest wavenumber, which is due to the elongation of Ti-O bonds is observed for x = 0.4.},

The effects of {HIPS} concentration, a mix of solvent, and the addition of acetone on the morphology and the diameter of fibers were observed. The morphological change from particles to fibers took place along with the increasing concentration of {HIPS} in d-limonene. For other precursor solutions using {DMF} solvent, bead free fibers could be obtained even at low levels. The average diameter of fibers increased along with the increase of the {HIPS} concentration in {DMF}.

For the precursor solutions with the combination of different solvents ({HIPS}/{DMF}), the existence of beads was influenced by the ratio of solvents. When the ratio of d-limonene/{DMF} was 75:25, the obtained beaded fibers had a relatively large amount of beads. At the ratio of 50:50, fewer beads were found. Bead-free fibers were finally reached when the ratio of {HIPS} / {DMF} was 25:75. The addition of acetone reduced the diameter of the produced fibers. However, too much addition of acetone caused the fibers to be wet. Additionally, the diameter became larger if the addition of acetone surpassed a certain amount of volume.},

The {SEM} images showed that the {PVP}/{GTE} nanostructures had a combination of agglomerated beads (less spherical particles) and nanofibers. This occurred because if the {PVP} concentration is low, the {PVP}/{GTE} composite has weak core structures that cause the shell to be easily agglomerated each other.

The effect of filler on morphological and mechanical characteristics was studied. Utilization of human cadaver in means of medical study has been commonly used primarily as tools of medical teaching and training such as surgery. Nonetheless, human cadaver brought inevitable problems. So it is necessary to find a substitute material that can be used to replace cadavers. In orthopaedics, the materials that resemble in mechanical properties to biological tissues are elastomers such as natural rubber (latex) and synthetic rubber (polyurethanes, silicones). This substitution material needs to consider the potential of Indonesia to help the development of the nation. Indonesia is the second largest country producer of natural rubber in the world. This paper aims to contribute to adjusting the mechanical properties of tissue-mimicking materials ({TMMs}) to the recommended range of biological tissue value and thus allow the development of phantoms with greater stability and similarity to human tissues. Repeatability for the phantom fabrication process was also explored. Characteristics were then compared to the control and mechanical characteristics of different human body part tissue. Nanosilica is the best filler to produce the best nanocomposite similarities with human tissue. We produced composites that approaching the properties of human internal tissues.},

The aim of this study is to determine whether a molecule of the {MAA} can be functioned as a bio-sensing of glucose. In this calculation, the Gaussian 09 with B3LYP and 631+G(d) basis sets is used to calculate all electronic properties. It is found that the interaction between a molecule of {MAA} and a molecule of D-Glucose was observed through the shortened distance between the two molecules. The binding energy of {MAA}/D-glucose and the Mulliken population analysis are investigated for checking possible interaction. From analysis, the {MAA} based {MIP} can be used as a bio-sensing material.},

	abstract = {A new solar photocatalytic reactor (photoreactor) using {TiO} 2 nanoparticles coated onto plastic granules has been designed. Catalyst granules are placed into the cavity of a reactor panel made of glass. A pump is used to circulate wastewater in the photoreactor. Methylene blue ({MB}) dissolved in water was chosen as the wastewater model. The performance of the photoreactor was evaluated based on changes in {MB} concentration with respect to time. The photoreactor showed a good performance by degrading 10 L of {MB} solution up to 96.54\% after 48 h of solar irradiation. The photoreactor was scaled up by enlarging the panel area to twice its original size. The increase in the surface area of the reactor panel and therefore of the mass of catalyst granules and reactor volume led to a three-fold increase of the photodegradation rate. In addition, the {MB} degradation kinetics were also studied. Data analysis confirmed the applicability of the pseudo-first-order Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The proposed photoreactor has great potential for use in large-scale wastewater treatment.},

To These precursors, silica nanoparticles were added at various concentrations from 0 to 5 \%wt. The emission wavelength produced by the phosphor was varied by varying the fraction mass of the silica that were added to the precursors.

In polymer gel electrolyte system, hybrid copolymer based on poly-{TMSPMA} (3-methoxysilyl propyl methacrylate) was used as a matrix to trap ionic liquid. An addition of aluminum as atom dopant also studied to observe the physical properties changes of photoanode related to solar cell performance. {AlCl} 3 was used as dopant material with the concentrations at 0.5 weight \% and 1.0 weight\% of zinc acetate dehydrate as raw material. Based on our previous result, the existence of Al dopant would decrease the surface roughness of {ZnO} layer, reduce the grain size of {ZnO} particles, transmittance at visible light increase and also change the charge carrier density. Nevertheless, the highest efficiency was achieved for undoped {ZnO}/{TiO} 2 photoanode (η=0.67\%). Based on current-voltage measurement data analysis (using diode model equation) the ideality factor ( n ) of device using undoped {ZnO} was smaller ( n =2.96) than {AZO} 0.5 wt\% and 1.0 wt\% ( n =∼4), indicate better quality of undoped {ZnO}/{TiO} 2 interfaces rather than {AZO}/{TiO} 2 .},

We found that the liquid-solid phase transition occurs rather gradually, which might be due to the fact that co\_oil consists of many kinds of fatty acids with the largest amount of lauric acid (about 50\%), with relatively small supercooling degree. For this reason, the end of phase transition region become smeared out, although the inflection point in the temperature derivative is clearly observed signifying the drastic temperature variation between the phase transition and solid phase periods. The data have led to the values of mean specific heat of the solid and liquid co\_oil that are comparable to the pure lauric acid, while the value for heat of fusion is resemble to those of the {DSC} result, both from references data. The advantage of co\_oil as the potential sensible and latent {TES} for room-temperature conditioning application in Indonesia is discussed in terms of its rather broad working temperature range due to its mixture composition characteristic.},

The analysis of unprotected loss of flow({ULOF}) and unprotected rod run-out transient overpower ({UTOP}) are discussed. Some simulations for 800 {MWt} Pb-208 cooled fast reactors has been performed and the results show that the reactor can anticipate complete pumping failure inherently by reducing power through reactivity feedback and remove the rest of heat through natural circulations. Compared to the Pb-nat cooled long life Fast Reactors, Pb-208 cooled reactors have smaller Doppler but higher coolant density reactivity coefficient. In the {UTOP} accident case the analysis has been performed against external reactivity up to 0.003dk/k. And for {ULOHS} case it is assumed that the secondary cooling system has broken. During all accident the cladding temperature is the most critical. Especially for the case of {UTOP} accident. In addition the steam generator design has also consider excess power which may reach 50\% extra during severe {UTOP} case..},

Loaded fuel of Plutonium compositions are based on spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) of light water reactor ({LWR}) for different fuel burnup process and cooling time conditions of the reactors. Obtained results show that different initial fuels of plutonium gives a significant chance in criticality conditions and fuel conversion capability. Loaded plutonium based on higher burnup process gives a reduction value of criticality condition or less excess reactivity. It also obtains more fuel breeding ratio capability or more breeding gain. Some loaded plutonium based on longer cooling time of {LWR} gives less excess reactivity and in the same time, it gives higher breeding ratio capability of the reactors. More composition of even mass plutonium isotopes gives more absorption neutron which affects to decresing criticality or less excess reactivity in the core.

Geothermal heat flow is important parameter in modeling of subsurface temperature. The subsurface temperature is one of vulcanic activity parameter which very important for nuclear site plant risk assesment. The integrated modeling for predicting subsurface temperature profile is carried out by combining geothermal heat flow and subsurface profiles resulted from either seismic or gravity measurement. The finite difference of Fourier’s law is applied to surface temperature, temperature gradient, geothermal heat flow and thermal conductivity profile for producing subsurface temperature distribution accurately. This subsurface temperature profile is essential to characterize the vulcanic zone whether it is still active or inactive. Characterization of vulcanic activity is very useful to ensure or to minimize the risk of nuclear site plant in vulcanic zone.

Many experiments have been conducted to reveal the mechanism of corrosion and mechanism of how to overcome the corrosion. In the previous work, we had shown computationally that the oxygen atom can be used to reduce the corrosion and we had predicted the oxygen contents. In the current work, not only to explore deeeper the ability of oxygen gas to reduce the corrosion, but also to include the variation of used temperature. We still used iron material to represent a real steels. Using {MD} (molecular dynamics) simulation based on the Lennard-Jones interaction potential, we sought to understand the concentration of oxygen gas as variation of temperature used in the reactor for the best corrosion mitigation. From this work, we conclude that the temperature does not give effect in related with how concentration of injected oxygen. The temparature merely affects to rise the diffusion coefficient of iron in liquid lead, yet it does not influence how much oxygen needed for corrosion mitigation. In this work, all simulations on different series of temperatures (1023 ° K, 1073 ° K, 1123 ° K, 1173 ° K) reveals that oxygen content of 0.1151wt\% will cause the lowest corrosion level of iron in liquid lead.},

All these forces are used to get motion parameters of organism through molecular dynamics method with improved Euler algorithm. It is observed that the use of simplify to push-pull organ gives more effective motion than shrink- and swell-organs as reported in previous works. Comparison of use of single and multiple push-pull filaments are discussed here, where the single one requires phase difference between alternation of length of filament and drag coefficient of some sub-parts.

In this study, β-carotene was encapsulated into poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/{PVP} through electrospinning technique in order to protect β-carotene from degradation and to maintain the antioxidant properties. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving β-carotene (1 wt.\%) to various concentrations of {PVP} (6 wt.\%, 8 wt.\%, 10 wt.\%, and 12 wt.\%) in ethanol. {SEM} images showed the formation of nanoscale beaded fibers with generally increasing average diameter when the {PVP} concentration was increased except when the concentration of precursor solution was 12 wt.\% {PVP}. In this case, it became too viscous and caused clogging on the needle tip and the formation of multi-jets. The average diameters of {PVP}/β-carotene composite nanofibers were in the range of 176 to 306 nm. The analyses of Fourier Transform Infrared ({FTIR}) spectra proved the presence of structural changes in {PVP} nanofibers after being loaded by β-carotene as a result of molecular interaction between β-carotene and {PVP}. This was given by a significant shift of the peak at 1440 cm-1 to lower wavenumbers of the {FTIR} spectrum of {PVP}. The β-carotene was proven to retain their antioxidant ability even after being encapsulated into the {PVP} nanofibers as tested by the {DPPH} assay method.},

	abstract = {Nanofiber is one-dimensional material that has broad application. It can be formed by applying a high-voltage source to a polymer solution so that the polymer solution becomes charged. Usingthe high electric field, the charged polymer solution is formed as a Taylor cone and then drawn to the collector to form long, nanoscale fibers. This method is known as electrospinning. There are two types of electrospinning method; they are needle and needleless electrospinning. The latter is intended for mass production nanofibers because it can make tens to hundreds ofjets at a time. Therefore, the high-voltage source required for the needleless electrospinning process must have a higher voltage and current compared to those for the needle one. Accordingly, the high voltage power supply using a series-configuration Mazzilli {ZVS} flyback converter was designed and developed. The Mazzilli flyback converter was able to generate a high voltage with relatively high power. Two converters were connected in series to achieve more output voltage. The output voltage was adjusted by changing the input voltage. The single converter could generate a high voltage up to 34kV whereas the series-configuration converter could increase the voltage by 98.41\% to be 67kV. The output voltage of converter was relatively stable and good enough to perform nanofibers synthesis using the needleless electrospinning. Visual observation confirmed that the nanofibers were formed well on the collector.},

	abstract = {Rotary forcespinning ({RFS}) is a simple method of fabricating fibers with a high production rate and low production cost. It can modify fibers morphology by varying polymer concentration, the solution flow rate, and the speed of induction motor. The change in the motor speed affects fibers diameter distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a {PID} (proportional-integral-derivative) controller to maintain the stability of the speed during fibers production. A dimmer circuit to control the {AC} voltage supplied to the induction motor and a rotary encoder with a signal conditioner to measure the motor speed were used to regulate the motor speed. By applying the second Ziegler-Nichols tuning method, the {PID} controller constants, which are Kp, Ti, and Td, were obtained; Their values were 0.001242, 5, and 1.25, respectively. From the control system responses for the set points in the range of 16,000 to 28,000 rpm, it was shown that the control system has a fast response. In addition, a maximum overshoot of 345 rpm at the set point of 24,000 rpm and a maximum steady-state error of 335 rpm at the set point of 28,000 rpm were also obtained by the control system. Under a disturbance of 5 s given to the control system, the speed could be restored back to its original state within 34 s. Therefore, the speed regulation system was regarded as a good control system.},

A large number of products start to rely on the advancement of this field, which implies the dependence of several industies on the development of efficient synthesis devices. However, some of the methods that were established earlier possess several drawbacks which potentially outweigh the actual benefits. Therefore, to overcome the problems present in previous systems, a new method utilizing centrifugal force was developed in this research, which is called mini-Rotary Forcespinning. This method is the variant of the previous research which employed a similar machine with a larger scale. While the pre-existing instruments have been adequate to produce fibers, the control mechanism is rather complicated due to the usage of alternating current ({AC}). In this research, an initial design of the device, which is operable from 3000 rpm to 18000 rpm was established. Within the range, the device performed firmly with 17.4 gram weighing, which is crucial to the stability of the system as a whole. This research paper discusses the schematics and control mechanism, and the possibility of further synthesis operation is predicted.},

Commercially, Ideal Aerosmith developed various models of two- and three-axis positioning and rate table system with high resolution and accuracy. However, the utilization of the system is more suitable for military and aerospace technologies that require very high resolution and accuracy. The system is therefore expensive and not portable. This paper reports the development of simple single-axis motion table system to provide precise position and motion rate for testing a tilt sensor. The system was developed by using a stepper motor in which the direction of the movement can be set by adjusting the encountered electrical current in the motor. The resolution of stepper motor used in the developed system was 0.9o/step, whereas various types of tilt sensors and their applications require a tester system with higher resolution. A gears system was employed to improve the stepper motor resolution used in the developed motion table system. Under a certain design of the gears system, the developed motion table system could achieve a higher resolution of 0.018o/step. It has been found that the relationship between the number of steps of the stepper motor and the rotation angle of the developed motion table system was linear and same for forward and backward steps. Moreover, the developed single-axis motion table system moved consistently for either forward (up) or backward (down) rotations in the range of 0 to 180o as assessed by the accelerometer-based tilt sensor. The developed single-axis motion table system can therefore be used for testing tilt sensor.},

The effective diameter ( D eff ), the water equivalent diameter ( D w ), and the {SSDE} were calculated automatically from patient images. We investigated sixteen adult patients who underwent a {CT} head examination and thirty adult patients who underwent a {CT} thorax examination. Our results showed that the D w value in the thoracic region was 4.5\% lower than the value of D eff , while the D w value in the head region was 8.6\% higher than the value of D eff . The relationships between diameter ( D eff and D w ) and {CTDI} vol were distinctive. In the head region, decreasing the patient diameter resulted in a constant {CTDI} vol due to the tube current modulation ({TCM}) being off, while in the thoracic region decreasing the patient diameter resulted in a decrease in value of {CTDI} vol due to {TCM} being on.

	abstract = {In a few years, Indonesia experienced difficulties in maintaining energy security, the problem is the decline in oil production from 1.6 million barrels per day to 861 thousand barrels per day in 2012. However, there is a difference condition in 2015 until the third week in 2016, world oil prices actually fell at the lowest price level since last 12 years. The decline in oil prices due to oversupply of oil by oil-producing countries of the world due to the instability of the world economy. Wave of layoffs in Indonesia is a response to the decline in oil prices, this led to the energy and mines portfolios Indonesia feared would not be more advantageous than the portfolio in other countries. In this research, portfolio analysis will be done on energy and mining in Indonesia by using stock price data of energy and mines in the period 26 November 2010 until April 1, 2016. It was found that the results have a wide effect of the market potential is high in the determination of the return on the portfolio energy and mines. Later, it was found that there are eight of the thirty stocks in the energy and mining portfolio of Indonesia which have a high probability of return relative to the average return of stocks in a portfolio of energy and mines.},

	abstract = {Zinc oxide ({ZnO}) nanorods ({NRs}) were successfully prepared by self-assembly methods using zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine as raw materials. {ZnO}-{NRs} were grown on {FTO}/{ZnO} seed layer and to enhance dye adsorption it was continued by deposition of titania ({TiO} 2 ) paste by screen printing method. Deposition time of {ZnO}-{NRs} were varied, for 120, 150 and 180 minutes and subsequently stacked with one layer of {TiO} 2 mesoporous. The resulting heterojunction layers of {FTO}/{ZnO}-Nrs/{TiO} 2 was then applied as a photoanode in quasi-solid dye sensitized solar cell ({QS}- {DSSC}) with polymer gel electrolyte ({PGE}) as a hole conductor. {UV}-Vis spectrometer was used to investigate the changes of dye adsorption in photoanode with/without inserting titania mesoporous. Characterizations of scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) and X-ray diffraction was carried out and the results shows that increasing the deposition time produces a smaller average grain size, diameter and denser layer of {ZnO}-nanorods. From current-voltage measurement, higher efficiency ( η = 2.53\%) was obtained for 120 min {ZnO} nanorods with short circuit current density (J sc ) of 2.84 {mA}/cm 2 and open circuit voltage (V oc ) of 0.7 V. The combination of {TiO} 2 and {ZnO}-{NRs} shows a better performance in solar cells characteristics due to increases of dye adsorption on photoanode and high photogenerated electron transport rate. This work emphasizes an optimum condition of {ZnO}-{NRs} in combination with {TiO} 2 mesoporous as an alternative photoanode in {QS}-{DSSC}.},

Copper oxide ({CuO}) nanostructures were prepared by combining the thermal evaporation with dry oxidation. We select {CuO} system at different thickness (around 90, 170, and 270 nm) and X-ray diffraction spectra confirms their polycrystalline structure. Scanning electron microscope images show the distinct {CuO} morphology surface for each sample on which the grain shape is changed and the size is grown with the increasing of the {CuO} thickness. Fourier-transform infra-red spectra reveals the high penetration depth of oxygen at ∼90 nm thick sample indicated by large Si-O-Si bond intensity. Photo current characterization for each sample is carried out to compare its light sensing properties. We found that the thickness of {CuO} nanostructure system is related to the sensitivity of device during the light exposure in which thinner samples have better performance. Furthermore different band gap for each {CuO} sample is predicted from its sensitivity at continuous light exposure. We suggest that the grain boundary and the distinct morphology might promote a unique confined nanostructure effect, resulting in band gap widening. These studies demonstrate a new approach for tunable photonic device efficiency that could be beneficial in reducing energy loss during energy conversion.},

Accurate prediction of scaling tendency is needed to plan treatment and operating condition during the production from gas field. In this study, we develop mathematical model to predict the scaling tendency in gas production pipes. The model consists of two basic equations: precipitation rate and erosion equation. Precipitation rate is calculated using semi-empirical correlation and erosion is calculated using Salama (2000) equation. Then, a modified parameter of scaling tendency ({ST}), which is the ratio between net precipitation rate and corrosion rate, is introduced to measure the scaling tendency in each segment of production pipe. From simulation, it was found that the interaction between pressure, temperature and fluid composition affected the scaling tendency at most. However, when sand was introduced in the pipe flow, scale formation occurred at low rate. Every segment of production tubing and pipeline gave different tendency condition.},

It is found that some macrostates (more appropriately is its maximum value) have larger thermodynamics probability than the others. It should be a relation between this probability and reported tortuosity.},

One of the devices to process renewable energy is Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell ({PEMFC}) . {PEMFC} use hydrogen and Oxygen as an energy sources . The most important reaction in fuel cell is Oxidation and reduction process. Therefore, a catalyst is needed to help the {OR} process. Study of catalyst shows that the most effective fuel cell for now is Platinum. Many fuel cell have use platinum as the catalyst. However, Platinum is a rare and expensive element. Therefore, to reduce the cost of fuel cell fabrication, we need to increase the activity of platinum. In this research, we use graphene as a support material. Then, we will study about the interaction of platinum on graphene and analyze its morphological change and electronic properties.The research conduct using Density Functional Theory ({DFT}).

These experimental results also showed that the best crystallization degree is obtained from 1.0 M precursor solution.

By understanding the fluid flow and heat transfer in porous medium, it help us to understand the phenomena in geothermal reservoir, such as thermal change because of injection process. Thermal change in the reservoir is the most important physical property to known since it has correlation with performance of the reservoir, such as the electrical energy produced by reservoir. In this simulation, we investigate the fluid flow and heat transfer in geothermal reservoir as a simple flow in porous medium canal using Lattice Boltzmann Method. In this simulation, we worked on 2 dimension with nine vectors velocity (D2Q9). To understand the fluid flow and heat transfer in reservoir, we varied the fluid temperature that inject into the reservoir and set the heat source constant at 410°C. The first variation we set the fluid temperature 45°C, second 102.5°C, and the last 307.5°C. Furthermore, we also set the parameter of reservoir such as porosity, density, and injected fluid velocity are constant. Our results show that for the first temperature variation distribution between experiment and simulation is 92.86\% match. From second variation shows that there is one pick of thermal distribution and one of turbulence zone, and from the last variation show that there are two pick of thermal distribution and two of turbulence zone.},

A small long-life reactor based on thorium fuel cycle for several reactor coolant types and several power output has been evaluated in the present study for 10 years period of reactor operation. Several key parameters are used to evaluate its effect to the reactor performances such as reactor criticality, excess reactivity, reactor burnup achievement and power density profile. Water-cooled types give higher criticality than liquid metal coolants. Liquid metal coolant for fast reactor system gives less criticality especially at beginning of cycle ({BOC}), which shows liquid metal coolant system obtains almost stable criticality condition. Liquid metal coolants are relatively less excess reactivity to maintain longer reactor operation than water coolants.

Corrosion affects the management system of a field and further impacts the amount of investment. Therefore, accurate prediction of corrosion rate is needed to plan an effective preventive action before going further to the development phase. One of the important parameters that should be noticed to create an accurate prediction is the formation of the passive layer. In {CO} 2 -H 2 S environment, there will be three possibilities of passive layer: {FeS}, {FeCO} 3 or no passive layer. In this study, we create mathematical models to determine the formed passive layer in each segment of the gas production tubing and pipeline. The model is built using Faraday’s Law and Thermodynamic approach to account the passive layer formation at different temperature, {pH}, corrosion rate and partial pressure of {CO} 2 and H 2 S. From the simulation, it was found that there were three boundary conditions: no scale-{FeS} boundary, no scale-{FeCO} 3 boundary and {FeS}-{FeCO} 3 boundary. The first two boundaries evolved over a time as the concentration of Fe 2+ ions was increasing. However, {FeS}-{FeCO} 3 boundary remained steady as it was not affected by the addition of Fe 2 + ions. Using sample case study, few variations were noticed at production pipeline and tubing. It was caused by the gas composition, which contained high {CO} 2 and very low H 2 S. Boundary conditions only changed slightly over two days period.},

We have developed software to perform both inversion methods accompanied by a user-friendly interface. Both of the methods were compared one another to determine the number of iteration, robust to noise, elapsed time of computation, and inversion results. {SVD} inversion generated faster process and better results than {LM} did.

	abstract = {The study of digital rock physics has seen significant advances due to the development of X-ray micro computed tomography scanning devices. One of the advantages of using such a device is that the pore structure of rock can be mapped down to the micrometre level in three dimensions. However, in providing such high-resolution images (low voxel size), the resulting file sizes are necessarily large (of the order of gigabytes). Lower image resolution (high voxel size) produces smaller file sizes (of the order of hundreds of megabytes), but risks losing significant details. This study describes the effect of the image resolution obtained by means of hardware-based and software-based approach. Four samples of porous rock were scanned using a {SkyScan} 1173 High Energy Micro-{CT}. We found that acquisition using increased pixel binning of the camera (hardware-based resizing) significantly affects the calculated physical properties of the samples. By contrast, voxel resizing by means of a software-based approach during the reconstruction process yielded less effect on the porosity and specific surface area of the samples. However, the decreasing resolution of the image obtained by both the hardware-based and the software-based approaches affects the permeability significantly. We conclude that simulating fluid flow through the pore space using the Lattice Boltzmann method to calculate the permeability has a significant dependency on the image resolution.},

The ferroelectric–paraelectric transition (Tc {\textasciitilde}800 K for x = 0.2 and {\textasciitilde}765 K for x = 0.4) is well mirrored by the Raman scattering near 60 cm−1 arising from the so-called rigid layer mode. The temperature dependence of the phonon mode near 42 cm−1 arising from A-site Pb/Bi displacements indicates a second structural transformation near 570 K and 400 K for x = 0.2 and 0.4, respectively, similar to that observed for Mn-free {PbBi}4Ti4O15. This structural alteration resembles a thermodynamically second-order phase transition for all three compounds and the critical temperature (Ta) decreases with the increase in the A-site Bi3+ amount, related to the heterovalent substitution (Mn3+ for Ti4+) on the B site; Ta = 600, 570, 400 K for x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, respectively. The {BO}6 tilting and bending mode near 220 cm−1 also shows an anomaly at Ta, and, thus, this second structural transformation was attributed to subtle rearrangements of A-site cations accompanied by octahedral {BO}6 tilting in the perovskite-like blocks.

The quantum dot is considered as a three-level ladder system with ground, one-exciton, and bi-exction states. As compared to the case of a two-level quantum dot model, adding the third (bi-exciton) state produces fascinating effects in the optical response of the hybrid system. Specifically, we demonstrate that the system may exhibit picosecond and sub-picosecond self-oscillations and quasi-chaotic behaviour under single-frequency continuous wave excitation. An isolated semiconductor quantum dot does not show such features. The effects originate from competing one-exciton and bi-exciton transitions in the semiconductor quantum dot, triggered by the self-action of the quantum dot via the metal nanoparticle. The key parameter that governs the phenomena mentioned is the ratio of the self-action strength and the bi-exciton shift. The self-oscillation regime can be achieved in practice, in particular, in a heterodimer comprised of a closely spaced {ZnS}/{ZnSe} core-shell quantum dot and a spherical silver nanoparticle. The results may have applications in nanodevices for generating trains of ultrashort optical pulses.},

In the present study, a bright red emission (emission wavelength 620 nm under 365 nm {UV} excitation) of a manganese-doped {BCNO} ({BCNO}:Mn) phosphor synthesized by a solid state method is reported. Without Mn-doping, the {BCNO} phosphor exhibited a bright blue emission that can be ascribed to the closed-shell {BO}− and {BO}2− anions that act as luminescence center. Via Mn-doping, a red emission was exhibited that can be ascribed to the 4T1(4G) → 6A1(6S) transition from a new luminescence center of Mn2+ incorporated into the {BCNO} host lattice. The optimum red {PL} properties (λem: 611 nm, λex: 365 nm) were obtained with {BCNO}:Mn at a molar ratio of Mn/B at 0.71\% mol/mol synthesized at 550 °C.

The copper bridges were synthesized by the pulse voltage electroplating method, and the effect of the pulse duty cycle was explored. The amount of copper deposited between {TiO}2 particles can be controlled by varying the duty cycles and the deposition time. We found that the cell fabricated by the deposition of copper at duty cycles of 60\% and a deposition time of 30s exhibited the highest efficiency (2.21\%).

Efficiencies of more than 3\% for solar cells made by a simple method and using inexpensive materials make these solar cells promising competition for the current commercial solar cells.},

The calculation results showed that the adhesive energy of {CNTs} and clean Al2O3(0001) depends on the diameter of {CNTs}. The structures of the {CNTs} adsorbed on Al-terminated Al2O3(0001) do not drastically change from those before adsorbing. C atoms of {CNTs} interacted with the topmost Al atom of Al2O3(0001) by forming covalent bonding. In the case of the O-terminated Al2O3(0001), small-diameter {CNTs} have strong interaction, which comes from the opening of {CNTs} catalytically induced by the O-terminated surface and the subsequent formation of mixed covalent-ionic bonding between C and O atoms. This strong interfacial interaction also leads to significant charge transfer from the {CNTs} to the O-terminated Al2O3(0001). The strong interfacial interaction of small diameter {CNTs} with the O-terminated Al2O3(0001) would be a possible mechanism for the successful Al2O3 composite reinforced with {CNTs}.},

Most α-amylases have been classified in glycoside hydrolase family 13 with a typical (β/α)8-barrel containing two aspartic acid and one glutamic acid residue that play an essential role in catalysis. An atypical α-amylase ({BmaN}1) with only two of the three invariant catalytic residues present was isolated from Bacillus megaterium strain {NL}3, a bacterial isolate from a sea anemone of Kakaban landlocked marine lake, Derawan Island, Indonesia. In {BmaN}1 the third residue, the aspartic acid that acts as the transition state stabilizer, was replaced by a histidine. Three-dimensional structure modeling of the {BmaN}1 amino acid sequence confirmed the aberrant catalytic triad. Glucose and maltose were found as products of the action of the novel α-amylase on soluble starch, demonstrating that it is active in spite of the peculiar catalytic triad. This novel {BmaN}1 α-amylase is part of a group of α-amylases that all have this atypical catalytic triad, consisting of aspartic acid, glutamic acid and histidine. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this group of α-amylases comprises a new subfamily of the glycoside hydrolase family 13.},

	abstract = {Microalgae-derived oils have potential as a biofuel feedstock. To produce microalgal oils at a large scale, large amounts of nutrients and energy are needed to grow the algae. In this study, we evaluated three types of agricultural fertilizer ({AF})-based culture media ({AF}1, {AF}2, and {AF}3) based on a previously published enriched seawater ({ES}) medium to produce biomass and oils from Thalassiosira sp. Under laboratory conditions, the highest cell productivity of Thalassiosira sp. was obtained with the {AF}3 medium. Thalassiosira sp. cultured in the {AF}3 medium produced 10.4 ± 0.9 mg L−1 day−1oils, which is significantly higher than the 5.8 ± 0.7 mg L−1 day−1produced in the {ES} medium. The higher production was due to the presence of nitrate and trace elements, both of which played roles in enhancing biomass and oil content, respectively. During cell growth, resting spores appeared inside the cells and were a marker to harvest the cells. Because of the abundant availability of sunlight in the tropics during the year, the oil production of Thalassiosira sp. in the {AF}3 medium was scaled up using outdoor photobioreactors under different weather conditions (rainy and dry seasons). Thalassiosira sp. produced more unsaturated fatty acids during the rainy season and produced more saturated fatty acids during the dry season. This study also demonstrated that it was possible to culture Thalassiosira sp. under outdoor conditions using a low-cost agricultural fertilizer-based culture medium ({AF}3 medium) to produce biodiesel feedstock with an annual production of 8.1 ± 0.4 t ha−1 during the dry season and of 23.9 ± 6.8 t ha−1 during the rainy season.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model of micro-finance investment using profit-loss sharing scheme are made and implemented to simulated data. Here profits from the venture will be shared in a portion between the investor and the entity running the business. The scheme can be classified as Musharaka type of investment in Sharia economy. The proposed model is theoretically implemented with data from small-scale traders at a local traditional market who have small turnover. They are common target of usurers who lend money with high interest rate and penalties. If the traders are in unfortunate conditions, they are potentially in poorer condition than before committing themselves to the usurer. In the conventional practices of the profit sharing scheme, the investor will get a fixed portion of the trader’s income, which is applied for all kind of small-scale traders. If the traders are diligent and hard worker and have very high turnover, then the investor will gain much more profit whether the contributed capital is small or large. In this paper, the scheme is implemented using Semi-Fuzzy Logic Approach so that the profit-loss sharing scheme can achieve its intended goal, which is to make a profitable investment not only for the investor but also for traders. The approach is not fully using Fuzzy Logic because some variables are still in crisp numbers and the optimization problem is regular in the form of crisp numbers. Based on the existing data, the results show that the optimal profit share is depended on the income of the traders. The higher the income coming from the venture, the lesser the profit share for the investor which is reasonable with the fixed initial contributed capital. Keywords: Profit-Loss Sharing, Fuzzy logic, Musharaka, Optimization, Mathematical {modelJEL} Classification: C61, D60},

	abstract = {An unstructured model for the growth of yeast cell on glucose due to growth inhibitions by substrate, products, and cell density is discussed. The proposed model describes the dynamical behavior of fermentation system that shows multiple steady states for a certain regime of operating parameters such as inlet glucose and dilution rate. Two types of steady state solutions are found, namely washout and non-washout solutions. Furthermore, different numerical impositions to the two parameters put in evidence three results regarding non-washout solution: a unique locally stable non-washout solution, a unique locally stable non-washout solution towards which other nearby solutions exhibit damped oscillations, and multiple non-washout solutions where one is locally stable while the other is unstable. It is also found an optimal inlet glucose which produces the highest cell and ethanol concentration.},

The enhancement varies with different emission wavelengths and nanoplate diameters in accordance with results obtained through the dipole radiation power in the electromagnetic simulations. From experiment, the quantum yield of N-{GQDs} is obtained to be almost unity, while Bi2Te3 nanoplates may replace the conventional antenna.

Metal-semiconductor-metal ({MSM}) planar structure was fabricated by using silver (Ag) contact on {ZnO} thin films as photodetector.

I-V characteristics of reverse-forward bias of {UV} photodetector were taken in dark and light conditions. As the results, amorphous phase of {RT} {ZnO} shows the high value of dark current and photocurrent. High stability of photo detection is also observable over the specific time as investigated by switching condition. In addition, we found that the mechanism of photo detection is strongly related to the oxygen adsorption on the {ZnO} surface. This study provides an alternative way to have a simple and high sensitive {UV} photodetector.},

The pure {ZnO} and {ZnO}:3\%Ti ({TZO}) films were deposited on Si substrates by using {DC}-unbalanced magnetron sputtering. From the scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) images, the {TZO} film grows more homogeneously in comparison with the pure {ZnO} structure. We suggest that Ti dopants play a role in uniformly distributing {ZnO} elements from the sputtering target to the Si substrate. The transmittance spectra of the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy show a peak splitting of Zn–O stretching in the {TZO} film, which is also related to the dopant-modified film morphology. X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) spectra show that the Ti dopants also change the main {ZnO} crystal orientation from (0 0 2) to (1 0 3). The {ZnO} and {TZO} film-based photodetectors were fabricated by using a metal–semiconductor–metal planar configuration with Ag as the metal contact. Based on the I–V characteristics, Ti doping in the {ZnO} system reduces the dark current and induces the enhancement of the photo-to-dark-current ratio. Our study shows the important role of Ti doping on the improvement of photodetection performance.},

These carbazole dyes have similar structures and their main difference lies on the position of their alkyl chain substituent. The calculated absorbance-spectra of the three dyes in the {UV}–visible range are in good agreement with the experimental results. The {HOMO}–{LUMO} analysis reveals that the {SD}4 dye has a better charge separation and a {LUMO} position slightly higher compared to the others. Calculations have been carried out to quantify the intramolecular charge-transfer ({ICT}). The result shows that {JM}2 has the highest {qCT} but unfortunately accompanied by a short {dCT} which indicates that the opportunity of electron recombination is high in {JM}2. The computational results also indicate that {SD}4 is the most promising candidate as a sensitizer in {DSSC} compared to {JM}1 and {JM}2. These results are in agreement with our experimental test using iodide-based electrolyte. On the other hand, the experiments show that {JM}2, which has two hexyl chains located in the edge of molecule, has the best performance when coupled with cobalt-based electrolyte.},

Dimethyl sulfoxide was used to dissolve each curcumin analog compound, and then diluted with biological buffer. They were then mixed with {CA}-{II} solution and to start the reaction, 4-{NPA} was added. Hydrolysis of the substrate was evaluated at 405 nm after incubation for 2 h at 25 °C. The {IC}50 value of compounds with inhibitory activity higher than 40 \% was then evaluated. Molecular docking was also used to predict enzymeinhibitor interaction.Results: Eight new curcumin analogs were potent to inhibit {CA}-{II} activity with {IC}50 values ranging from 7.92 ± 0.54 to 72.31 ± 2.21 μmol; the lowest value was exhibited by (3E,5E)-3,5-bis[(2- hydroxyphenyl)methylidene]piperidin-4-one (a1). Molecular docking analysis revealed that this molecule formed hydrogen bonds with Thr199, Thr200 and Gln92 at the active site of {CA}-{II}.Conclusion: These curcumin analogs have inhibitory potential against {CA}-{II}; (3E, 5E)-3,5-bis[(2- hydroxyphenyl)methylidene]piperidin-4-one (a1) has the highest inhibitory activity and may be useful in the development of {CA}-{II} inhibitors for glaucoma treatment.Keywords: Carbonic anhydrase {II} inhibitor, Curcumin analogs, Molecular docking},

	abstract = {Nanofiber mats of polyvinyl(pyrrolidone) ({PVP}) with Garcinia mangostana extract ({GME}) as the encapsulated drug have been developed using electrospinning. {SEM} images of all electrospun {PVP}/{GME} composite nanofiber mats showed that they had similar and smooth morphology, no beads, and spindle shape. Its average diameter decreased and its surface area therefore increased with the decrease of its {PVP} concentration. The benefit of high surface area is obvious in drug delivery systems for poorly water-soluble drugs. Their {FTIR} spectra indicated that {PVP} and {GME} interacted intermolecularly via hydrogen bonds in the composite nanofiber mats. A conformational change in the C-H chain of {PVP} occurred in the composite nanofiber mats due to the intermolecular interactions. Their {XRD} patterns confirmed that they were amorphous because of amorphization during electrospinning. The {XRD} analyses also strengthened the {FTIR} studies; namely, {GME} and {PVP} formed intermolecular interactions in the electrospun composite nanofiber mats. As a result, {GME} as the encapsulated drug was molecularly dispersed in the electrospun {PVP} nanofiber matrix that functioned as a drug delivery system. From the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ({DPPH}) assay, the composite nanofiber mats exhibited very high antioxidant activities despite having been exposed to high voltage during electrospinning. Therefore, they are potential antioxidant products for food and pharmaceutics.},

However, since this defined gravitoelectromagnetic field strength does not give rise to a complete set of Maxwell-like equations, we propose an alternative definition of the gravitoelectromagnetic field strength: instead of superpotentials, torsions are taken as the gravitoelectromagnetic field strengths. Based on this new proposal, we are able to derive a complete set of Maxwell-like equations. We then apply them to obtain explicit expressions of the gravitoelectromagnetic fields both in Schwarzschilds spacetime and for gravitational waves.},

Nano-silica is an inorganic compound with a surface area of 200 m2/g, and it has a hygroscopic property so that the presence of nano-silica in membrane can increase properties of membrane. The {SPS}-{LS}-{SO}2 membranes were prepared by casting polymer solution and membranes were characterized by functional groups analysis, water uptake, ion exchange capacity ({IEC}), proton conductivity, methanol permeability, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and surface morphology. The results show the increase of nano-silica composition in {SPS}-{LS}-{SiO}2 membranes, the {IEC}, water uptake, proton conductivity increase, but a pore size of membrane decreases. On the other hand, it can maintain the mechanical strength of membranes. The {SPS}-{LS}-{SiO}2 membranes with nano-silica composition of 2\%–5\% (w/w) have the same properties with Nafion®117, especially in proton conductivity at the same treatment and measurement conditions, and its methanol permeability is about 28\%–35\% smaller than that of Nafion®117 (2.09 × 10−6 cm2/s), so this {SPS}-{LS}-{SiO}2 membrane could be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cell ({DMFC}) application.},

The resistivity of the heat-treated particle was as low as 0.04 Ω.cm, with a specific surface area of 52.9 m2 g−1. The effects of heat-treatment on changes in the crystal structure and their correlation with the electron conductivity are discussed based on transmission electron microscopy images, X-ray diffraction spectra, and X-ray adsorption fine structure spectra.

Calcination of the lysine–tungsten precipitate produced tungsten oxide powder of high purity (99.6\%) because the lysine is completely decomposed.

We investigated axial images of 75 patients who underwent {CT} examinations. Truncated axial images were characterized by the truncation percentage ({TP}). Correction factors were calculated by using the value of {DW} for a certain {TP} (truncated image) divided by the value of {DW} for {TP} = 0\% (the non-truncated image). Most of the thorax images acquired for this study were truncated images (86.2\%), in the abdomen region about half of the images were truncated (48.1\%), and in the head region only a small portion were truncated (9.1\%). In the thorax region the value of {TP} for the truncated images varied up to 50\%, in the abdomen region it varied up to 35\%, and in the head region it was smaller than 10\%. We have shown how to accurately estimate {DW} and {SSDE} by applying a correction factor to the truncated images. The correction factors increase exponentially with increasing {TP}.

The ionic diffusion coefficients of these {PGEs} are smaller than those of the pure ionic liquid, which may explain the observation of decreased cell performances in the {DSSCs} using these {PGEs}. However, from more detailed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ({EIS}) studies, there is a strong evidence that the cell performance is also limited by inefficient charge transfer and charge transport inside the mesoporous {TiO}2 layer. This is indicated by the absence of transmission line characteristics in the observed Nyquist plots. The present experimental results then indicate that the lack of electrolyte penetration into the mesoporous {TiO}2 layer, due to the {PGE} rheology behavior caused by the siloxane-based polymer gel used here, is another crucial limiting factor for the photovoltaic performance of {DSSCs} using this kind of {PGE}. We consider that this kind of gel phase effect may be also observed in {DSSCs} using other types of gel electrolytes, including polyionic liquids.},

These images were interpreted to classify the {LULC} in a particular area at a certain period. However, the process of visual interpretation might produce a pattern of land class change that does not match actual condition because it always has the potential to create different classification outcomes if compared using image data of higher resolution. Thus, it becomes highly important to verify satellite image data of the study area by generating an index of {LULC} change.
In this research, proportional stratified random sampling method was used. In this method, each sample of recorded {LULC} change was verified using a high-resolution image. The verification results were then tested using one-tailed t-test with 90\% confidence level. The product was an index of {LULC} Change where 1 (the number one) signified that change did/might happen and 0 (the number zero) signified that change did/might not happen.
From this research, {LULC} Change index with a resolution of 30 meters for the area of West Java Province was obtained. Cellular Autamata-Markov Chain model was used to test the application of this index to predict land cover in 2015. The most accurate result (accurate value = 40.3797\%) was obtained from using Von Neuman nearest neighbors method with 7x7 size.

	abstract = {The future of fuel cells that convert chemical energy to electricity relies mostly on the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction ({ORR}) due to its sluggish kinetics. By effectively bypassing the use of organic surfactants, the postsynthesis steps for immobilization onto electrodes, catalytic ink preparation using binders, and the common problem of nanoparticles ({NPs}) detachment from the supports involved in traditional methodologies, we demonstrate a versatile electrodeposition method for growing anisotropic microstructures directly onto a three-dimensional (3D) carbon felt electrode, using platinum {NPs} as the elementary building blocks. The as-synthesized materials were extensively characterized by integrating methods of physical (thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and electroanalytical (voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrometry) chemistry to examine the intricate relationship of material-to-performance and select the best-performing electrocatalyst to be applied in the model reaction of {ORR} for its practical integration into a microbial fuel cell ({MFC}). A tightly optimized procedure enables decorating an electrochemically activated carbon felt electrode by 40–60 nm ultrathin 3D-interconnected platinum nanoarrays leading to a hierarchical framework of ca. 500 nm. Half-cell reactions reveal that the highly rough metallic surface exhibits improved activity and stability toward {ORR} (Eonset ∼ 1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, p({HO}2–) {\textless} 0.1\%) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (−10 {mA} cm–2 for only 75 {mV} overpotential). Owing to its unique features, the developed material showed distinguished performance as an air-breathing cathode in a garden compost {MFC}, exhibiting better current and faster power generation than those of its equivalent classical double chamber. The enhanced performance of the material obtained herein is explained by the absence of any organic surfactants on the surface of the nanoarrays, the good metal–support interaction, particular morphology of the nanoarrays, and the reduced aggregation/detachment of particles. It promises a radical improvement in current surface reactions and paves a new way toward electrodes with regulated surface roughness, allowing for their successful application in heterogeneous catalysis.},

	abstract = {The peak of the luminescence spectrum of zinc oxide ({ZnO}) is usually observed above 500 nm (yellow region). By in-situ growth of {ZnO} nanoparticles in a poly(ethylene glycol) ({PEG}) matrix, we have succeeded in producing {ZnO}/polymer composites with stable luminescence peaks down to 465 nm (blue region). The unbalanced precursor molarity approach, where the molarity of one precursor ({LiOH}) is several times larger than the molarity represented by a chemical reaction balance, was used. The blue luminescence, which was accompanied by an enhancement of luminescence intensity, was observed at very high {LiOH} concentrations. This was probably due to the simultaneous reduction in the crystalline size and improvement in the crystallinity. Doping {ZnO} nanoparticles with europium also generated a red luminescence at 616 nm, due to the 5D0 →7F2 transition of Eu ions.},

The graph G is called (H 1, H 2)-magic, if there are two fixed positive integers k i and k 2, and a bijective function f : V(G) ∪ E(G) → 1, 2,…, {\textbar}V(G){\textbar} + {\textbar}E(G){\textbar} suchthat ∑ v∈V(H′) f(v) + ∑ e∈E(H′) f(e) = k 1 and ∑ v∈V(H″) f(v) + ∑ e∈E(H″) f(e) = k 2, for every subgraph H′ = (V(H′), E(H′)) of G isomorphic to H 1 and for every subgraph H″ = (V(H), E(H)) of G isomorphic to H 2. Moreover, it is said to be super (H 1,H 2)-magic, if f(V(G)) = 1, 2,…, {\textbar}V(g){\textbar}.

A shackle of G 1, G 2, G 3,…, Gk denoted by shack(G 1, G 2, G 3,…, Gk ) is a graph constructed from nontrivial connected and ordered graphs suchthat for every i and j ∈ [1, k] with {\textbar}i − j{\textbar} {\textgreater} 2, G i and Gj have no common vertex, and for every i ∈ [1, k − 1], Gi and G i+1 share exactly one common vertex, called linkage vertex, where the k − 1 linkage vertices are all distinct. In case G i is isomorphic to H 1 for odd i and Gi is isomorphic to H 2 for even i, we denote such shackle by shack(H 1, H 2, k). We give a sufficient condition for some shack(H 1, H 2, k) being (H 1, H 2)-supermagic for even k.},

This is a laboratory research method conducted using {SLS} surfactant of bagasse injection process with that of light crude oil. The core injection was reinforced by the tested {SLS} surfactant characteristics such as {IFT} and contact angle. The core injection using {SLS} surfactant showed a high recovery factor at the two areas, at 5000 ppm salinity and at salinity of 80,000 ppm. At a higher salinity level, it produced a larger contact angle of 20°–50°. The interfacial tension value also increased from 2.73 to 4.11 {mN}/m. The value of oil recovery at these salinity variations ranged from 9.25 to 1.80\%. The results of this research show that the mechanism of surfactant flooding depends on several parameters, like salinity, surfactant concentration, {IFT} and contact angle. The value of the formed contact angle also affects the performance of {SLS} surfactant in the oil purification process. Thus, it can be concluded that the parameters of the {SLS} surfactant in the injection process provide a synergetic effect on the oil recovery mechanism in terms of salinity, surfactant concentration, {IFT}, and contact angle.},

Candida antarctica lipase B (Cal-B) has been used as a catalyst in trans-esterification reaction. To improve the utilization of Cal-B, therefore the immobilization of Cal-B onto a polymer matrix became crucial. In this study, polyethersulfone ({PES}) and sulfonated polyethersulfone ({SPES}) membranes were used as matrices of Cal-B immobilization. {SPES} was previously synthesized by modifying {PES} using chlorosulfonic acid ({ClSO}3H) to improve the immobilization of Cal-B. {SPES}-{PSf} (polysulfone) blended membranes were also successfully prepared by blending {SPES}, {PSf}, and {PEG} in N-methylpyrrolidone ({NMP}) as the solvent using phase-inversion method. The attenuated total reflectance ({ATR})–{FTIR} spectrum showed characteristic peaks of the immobilized Cal-B on the matrix at peak 3184.03 cm−1 (–N–H bonds) and 1683.49 cm−1 (–{CH} deformation bonds). The Raman spectroscopy of the {PES}-based membranes before and after sulfonation reaction showed the deviations from the symmetrical structure of {PES}, with specific Raman shifts at 784.11 cm−1, 1150.95 cm−1, and 1588.9 cm−1. Cal-B was successfully immobilized and loaded onto {SPES} membrane. By Lowry assay, it was detected that 140.3 μg/cm2 enzyme was successfully loaded into the 17.3 cm2 of membrane. The value was one and a half times higher than {PES} (91.0 μg/cm2 in 17.3 cm2). However, the hydrolytic activity of Cal-B immobilized onto {SPES} membrane (17.0 p-{NP}/min/cm2) was five times lower than Cal-B immobilized onto {PES} membrane (80.4 p-{NP}/min/cm2).},

The synthesis was accomplished by acid-catalyzed condensation of naphthobipyrrole building blocks with aromatic aldehydes. The naphthobipyrrole building blocks were synthesized by simple oxidative coupling of the corresponding pyrrole substituted aromatics. Solid-state structural analyses of the synthesized naphthorosarins revealed that the presence of meso-2,6-dichlorophenyl- and 5,6-difluoro-substitution substantially alter the geometry and properties of the naphthorosarins. The substituents affect the redox potentials as well and, in turn, the proton-coupled electron-transfer processes leading to the formation of one- and two-electron reduced forms of the corresponding naphthorosarins. One particular naphthorosarin that bears both peripheral fluorine and meso-2,6-dichlorophenyl substituents forms a stable 25 π-electron species upon treating with {TFA} that was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The current study underscores how structural modifications can be used to fine-tune the electronic features of naphthorosarins, including stabilization of odd electron species.},

The essential oil from cloves can contain up to 90\% eugenol, which is mainly responsible for its aroma. Eugenol is an interesting compound due to its simplicity and richness in functionalities, making it a valuable building block in synthesis. One of the key steps in eugenol transformation is demethylation to produce a hydroxycavicol. Demethylation is commonly carried out using a nucleophilic or an acidic method. In this study, a simple yet reliable nucleophilic method for demethylation using lithium chloride ({LiCl}) was attempted. The product was characterized by {NMR}, {FTIR} and {HRMS} spectroscopy. The absence of a methoxy signal at 3.5-4 ppm in the 1H {NMR} spectrum suggests that demethylation was successful. The {HRMS} result showed m/z 149.0596, confirming the formation of product. The demethylation reaction under acidic conditions formed a dimer of eugenol with the methoxy group still intact. This was supported by the 1H {NMR} data, which showed methoxy signals at 3.85 and 3.82 ppm and integration in the aromatic region, which suggests a dimer structure.},

High wax content in crude oil will lead to high intermolecular interaction because of the increasing cohesion forces. It causes interfacial ({IFT}) tension between oil and brine to be high. Hence, oil recovery is relatively low. This paper presents formulation of an amphoteric sulfonate alkyl ester ({SAE}) surfactant with a nonionic surfactant (ester group) to reduce oil–brine {IFT} in waxy oil of T-{KS} field, in Indonesia. The ion–dipole forces may occur between {SAE} surfactant and nonionic cosurfactant molecules. The forces cause sulfonate chain to be attracted to oil phase. The formulated surfactant produces low interfacial tension between brine and waxy oil of T-{KS} oil field. Its ability to displace remaining oil in the pore space was also tested using coreflood tests. These tests demonstrate considerably good incremental recovery.},

Due to its ionic nature, it has affinity with water as well as organic compounds that make it potential to be developed as solvents with tuneable property. One class of material that possess this property is imidazolium compound which serves as organic cation. Variations of substituents (alkyl or aryl groups) in the parent cation provide several compounds that can be used as medium in various reactions. In this research, the synthesis of several imidazolium based ionic liquids had been performed utilizing Microwave Assisted Organic Synthesis ({MAOS}) method namely: butyl-methyl imidazolium chloride ({BMIM}-Cl), Decyl-methyl imidazolium bromide ({DMIM}-Br), Dodecyl-methyl imidazolium bromide ({DDMIM}-Br). The {ILs} were subsequently used as medium in cyclization reactions of diketone to provide an alternative route to flavanon. The structure of the synthesized {ILs} and the cyclization product were characterized by {FT}-{IR} and 1H-{NMR} spectroscopy. The yield of the synthesized {ILs} were moderate (24-87\%) while the yield of cyclization reactions was high (99\%). The formation of the cyclization product, was clearly indicated by the 1H-{NMR} spectrum with the peaks that appear at 6.81 ppm as singlet which corresponded to the proton at the pyranone ring.},

	abstract = {Introduction. A halophilic bacterium of the Halomonas elongata {BK}-{AG}25 has successfully produced ectoine with high productivity. To overcome the drawbacks of high levels of salt in the production process, a nonhalophilic bacteria of Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used to express the ectoine gene cluster of the halophilic bacteria, and the production of ectoine by the recombinant cell was optimized. Methods. The ectoine gene cluster from the halophilic bacterium was isolated and inserted into an expression plasmid of {pET}30(a) and subsequently transformed into E. coli {BL}21 ({DE}3). Production of ectoine from the recombinant E. coli was investigated and then maximized by optimizing the level of nutrients in the medium, as well as the bioprocess conditions using response surface methodology. The experimental designs were performed using a central composite design. Results. The recombinant E. coli successfully expressed the ectoine gene cluster of Halomonas elongata {BK}-{AG}25 under the control of the T7 promoter. The recombinant cell was able to produce ectoine, of which most were excreted into the medium. The optimization of ectoine production with the response surface methodology showed that the level of salt in the medium, the incubation temperature, the optical density of the bacteria before induction, and the final concentration of the inducer gave a significant effect on ectoine production by the recombinant E. coli. Interestingly, the level of salt in the medium and the incubation temperature showed an inverse effect on the production of intracellular and extracellular ectoine by the recombinant cell. At the optimum conditions, the production yield was about 418 mg ectoine/g cdw (cell dry weight) after 12 hours of incubation. Conclusion. This study is the first report on the expression of an ectoine gene cluster of Halomonas elongata {BK}-{AG}25 in E. coli {BL}21, under the control of the T7 promoter. Optimization of the level of nutrients in the medium, as well as the bioprocess condition using response surface methodology, has successfully increased the production of ectoine by the recombinant bacteria.},

The properties of polymer electrolyte membranes with various ratios of lithium perchlorate were studied by Thermogravimetric Analysis ({TGA}) and Scanning Electron Microscopy ({SEM}). The obtained {TGA} curves showed that these membranes were degraded thermally in three steps, which were attributed to dehydration, the main thermal degradation of the cellulose acetate chains, and the carbonization of the product to form ash. The thermal stability of the membrane decreased with the increase in {LiClO}4 content. The initial temperatures of the main degradation process decreased gradually from 330 °C in pure cellulose acetate membrane to 258 °C in cellulose acetate membrane containing 25\% lithium perchlorate. The morphology of the membranes transformed from dense to the more porous membrane along with the increase in lithium perchlorate ratios on membranes.},

Patient size was expressed in effective diameter (Deff), and was measured at nine slices along the z-axis. The normalized size-specific dose estimate ({nSSDE}) was then calculated. The normalized size-specific effective dose was obtained in the “effective dose” text-box by inputting an arbitrary value in the “{CTDI} (air)” text-box so that the “{CTDIvol}” text-box showed a similar value to the {nSSDE}.

In this study, we report our calculation results of the geometric structure and the electronic structure of these inorganic perovskites with various alkaline cation. The calculations were performed by employing the Density Functional Theory ({DFT}) method using Quantum Espresso computational software package. The calculation employed variable-cell relaxation algorithm (vc-relax) to obtain the lowest total energy value and the corresponding Density of States ({DOS}). In addition, Ultrasoft pseudopotentials and {PBE} exchange-correlation functions were used. The cut-off of kinetic energy was set at 40 Rydberg and the k-point was set at 5x5x5. The computation results lead to the energy gap range in 1.40 {eV} to 1.46 {eV}.

This paper will present an accurate methodology of rock’s thermal conductivity measurement by time-varying heat flow. The thermal conductivity measurements were done to various lithologies of rock samples from Java and Sumatra, including mud from Purwodadi Bledug Kuwu mudflow. The collected sample cover many lithologies, such as Limestone, Volcanic, Shale, Coal, and Sand.Particular measurement of time-varying heat flow has been designed and applied to various samples. The equipment consists temperature sensors, heat source, heat measurement and data recorder. The measurement results show that the thermal conductivity of shale rocks ranges from 0.414-2.749 J / s.m.°C, sandstone 0.931-2.748 J / s.m.°C, coal 0.353 J / s.m.°C whereas limestone carbonate is 0.92-6.86 J / s.m.°C. The thermal conductivity of each type of rock is unique, even for the same rock’s lithology may have different values. The thermal conductivity parameter is influenced by the particle size distribution, pore parameter including pore shape or pore structure, fracture parameter of rock, and even the fluid or water content in the rock pores.},

We used a circular homogeneous phantom (pixel value of 0.5) containing a small circle at its center, with a diameter of 0.53-cm and a pixel value of 1.0. In order to reconstruct the image, we used the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique ({SIRT}) with 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 iterations respectively, and {FBP} with a Ram-Lak filter. The spatial resolution of the reconstructed image was characterized by the modulation transfer function ({MTF}) and image noise was characterized by the standard deviation within the homogeneous area. We found that the spatial resolution using {SIRT} with 35 iterations is similar to using {FBP}. The spatial resolution using {SIRT} tends to be worse using less than 35 iterations, and it tends to be better using more than 35 iterations. Using {SIRT}, image noise decreased with increasing iterations. The standard deviation for the {SIRT} technique using 45 iterations was about 0.02 similar to the {FBP} technique. Thus, {SIRT} could potentially produce better spatial resolution than the {FBP} technique with comparable image noise.},

Water-equivalent diameter (Dw), size-specific dose estimates ({SSDE}) and noise were automatically calculated from the center slice for every patient image. The Dw was calculated based on auto-contouring of the patients’ edges, and the {SSDE} was calculated as the product of the volume {CT} dose index ({CTDIvol}) extracted from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ({DICOM}) header and the size conversion factor based on the Dw obtained from {AAPM} 204. The noise was automatically measured as a minimum standard deviation in the map of standard deviations. A square region of interest of about 1 cm2 was used in the automated noise measurement. The {SSDE} values for the pelvis, abdomen, thorax, and head were 21.8 ± 7.3 {mGy}, 22.0 ± 4.5 {mGy}, 21.5 ± 4.7 {mGy}, and 65.1 ± 1.7 {mGy}, respectively. The {SSDEs} for the pelvis, abdomen, and thorax increased linearly with increasing Dw, and for the head with constant tube current, the {SSDE} decreased with increasing Dw. The noise in the pelvis, abdomen, thorax, and head were 5.9 ± 1.5 {HU}, 5.2 ± 1.4 {HU}, 4.9 ± 0.8 {HU} and 3.9 ± 0.2 {HU}, respectively. The noise levels for the pelvis, abdomen, and thorax of the patients were relatively constant with Dw because of tube current modulation. The noise in the head image was also relatively constant because Dw variations in the head are very small. The automated approach provides a convenient and objective tool for dose optimizations.},

The calculated permeability will form analogue to hydraulic conductance networks. {RGA} were then applied to the networks for all three perpendicular directions using several {RGA} schemes, i.e., King, Karim–Krabbenhoft, Green–Paterson, and their combinations. It was shown that as the number of renormalizations increases, the average permeability decreases. The effective permeability calculated by combining {RGA} and {LBM} were lower than permeability of the single largest block. Karim and Krabbenhoft’s scheme produced mostly higher estimation than the others and closest to the true permeability. Degree of anisotropy is influenced by the initial block size prior to {RGA} scheme.},

In the present study, nuclear fuel sustainability aspect of conversion ratio, several fuel-recycling schemes, nuclear fuel composition and isotopic plutonium composition have been evaluated based on a water-cooled reactor of light water (H2O) and heavy water (D2O) as coolants for less ratio of moderator to fuel ({MFR}). Less fissile content is required for plutonium (Pu) recycling scheme than once through scheme for both coolant types and it requires more fissile content for heavy water coolant (D2O) of U-235 than light water coolant for both fuel cycle schemes. Plutonium recycling scheme obtains higher fuel conversion ratio than once through for both coolant types and more fuel conversion ratio is shown by heavy water coolant than light water coolant. It shows near fuel breeding can be obtained by light water coolant and breeder reactor capability can be obtained by heavy water coolant. Higher composition of trans-uranium including plutonium and minor actinides ({MA}) are shown by plutonium recycling case and heavy water coolant, which is estimated that can contribute to have more fuel-breeding capability. Composition of plutonium and americium increases significantly for heavy water coolant, while neptunium and curium compositions are almost the same for both coolants. Plutonium recycling scheme and heavy water coolant produces more even mass plutonium isotopes such Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242 as fertile material, which can be estimated to give better fuel breeding capability and higher level proliferation resistant.},

The purpose of this study was to compare the particles transport in X-ray target 6 {MV} photon beam using {EGSnrc} and {MCNPX} codes. This target has 0.2484 cm thickness consisting of 0.0899 cm Tungsten and 0.1575 Copper. The global cut-off energies used in the simulations for electron and photon were 500 {KeV} and 10 {KeV}, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations were performed for 6.4 {MeV} monoenergetic beam. The parameters used in this simulation were using the {DEFAULT} setting. The particles fluence, spectral distribution after target and simulation time were analysed in this simulation. The results showed that the spectrum from {EGSnrc} and {MCNPX} was not well-matched. There was under 5\% difference, especially in the build-up region. Meanwhile, the {EGSnrc} was 2 to 3 times more efficient than {MCNPX} code to achieve certain statistical precision. This happened because the differences of transport algorithm and approximation in these {MC} codes. {EGSnrc} just follow photons and electrons during simulation, while {MCNPX} can simulate transport 34 types of particles, including neutrons. It also causes the simulation time difference between these two codes. {MCNPX} simulation took longer than the {EGSnrc}. However, in some cases, differences in results as well as simulation time between 2 codes can be ignored.},

In this study, a simulation of the reconstruction of an image from a 32-channel Brain {ECVT} sensor using {NN}-{MOIRT} was conducted. The simulation was performed by varying the position and number of objects in the helmet-shaped Brain {ECVT} sensor.

The role of Gd3+ as contrast agent greatly helps to improve the quality of an image and Gadolinium entrance in a body through a diffusion process after administration. Diffusion process takes place from outside pre-synapse to inside pre-synapse through Ca2+ channels. This process causes a delay of Ca2+ in passing Ca2+ channels to pre-synapse. This study aims to determine equilibrium concentration of Ca2+ and Gd3+ so that Ca2+ can pass Ca2+ channels. To address the effect of Gd3+ concentration around Ca2+ channels, we developed a Monte Carlo simulation on Ca diffusion and interaction with Gd. We find Gd3+ concentration in a certain threshold can be potential as a blocker Ca2+ diffuse entrance into pre-synapse. In another hand, an amount of Ca2+ channels and pre-synapse terminal to continuing diffusion of vesicles to clef was important. And the trapping Gd3+ in pre-synapse effects in diffusion delays also. These simulations identify characteristics of the interaction between Ca2+ and Gd3+ in Ca channels which entrance into pre-synapse through diffusion process depend on concentration with each other.},

	abstract = {(Th,U)O2 fuel has been utilized for neutronic analysis of {HTTR} 30 {MWt} which is a high-temperature test reactor with helium gas as a coolant that has been built in Japan. {HTTR} has a Triple-isotropic Coated Fuel Particle ({TRISO} {CFP}) type of fuel. Homogenous fuel of (Th,U)O2 in the active core reactor give some different results for neutronic analysis such as effective multiplication factor (k-eff) each block fuel and whole of active core, conversion ratio, and spectrum of neutrons. The calculation was calculated by using neutronic {SRAC}2006 code and based on {JENDL}4.0 nuclear data which has been developed by {JAERI}. The results show that the optimum core may be obtained when (Th,U)O2 has 60\% of {ThO}2 and 16.8\% enrichment of {UO}2. The spectrum neutron shows that (Th,U)O2 fuel results in a softer spertrum.},

	abstract = {The subsurface temperature has many impacts on geological phenomena such as hydrocarbon generation, geothermal energy, mineralization, and geological hazards. The Northeast Java Basin has various interesting phenomena, such as many oil fields, active faults, mud eruptions, and some active and dormant volcanoes. We measured temperature data from tens of wells along a 130 km survey line with an average spacing of 5 km. We also measured the thermal conductivity of rocks of various lithologies along the survey line to provide geothermal heat flow data. We propose integrated modeling for profiling the subsurface temperature beneath the survey line from Mt. Lawu to Mt. Muriah in the Northeast Java Basin. The modeling of subsurface temperature integrates various input data such as a thermal conductivity model, surface temperature, gradient temperature, a geological model, and geothermal heat flow. The thermal conductivity model considers the subsurface geological model. The temperature modeling uses the finite difference of Fourier’s law, with an input subsurface thermal conductivity model, geothermal heat flow, and surface temperature. The subsurface temperature profile along with survey line shows some interesting anomalies which correlate with either subsurface volcanic activity or the impact of fault activity.},

	abstract = {Earth gravitational field influences physiological systems such as the cardiovascular and circulatory systems. Therefore changing the body position (standing, sitting, or supine) affects blood pressure. In addition to pressure, pumping blood throughout the body is also affected by the contraction of the hearts ventricles. The number of heartbeat per minute (pulse rate) for each person varies and is affected by physical activity. In this work, blood pressure and pulse rate for subjects in relax condition when supine, sitting, and standing positions are read using a set of digital sphygmomanometer {OMRON} type {JPN}-1. Blood pressure and pulse rate for subject after exercise are read in sitting position. From 14 subjects of this work, it was obtained that the blood pressure in brachial is lower than ankle in supine, sitting, and standing positions. The fluctuation range of ankle is about 7,4\% - 67,33\% which much higher than that in brachial about 0,7\% - 14,89\%. Furthermore, the difference magnitude value between brachial and ankle in sitting and standing positions is higher than in supine position. The ratio of the systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the systolic pressure at brachial is calculated for the ankle-brachial pressure index ({ABPI}). It was obtained that in relax condition the {ABPI} value of all subjects was relatively normal, meanwhile the results on post-exercise indicated that 2 smoker subjects were in risky condition of {PAD}. The human circulatory system in the arteries is analysed using the Bernoulli equation to estimate the mass density of the blood from the slope of a blood pressure to altitude curve. The blood density of 2 subjects is higher than the reference normal density (1060 kg/m3) and the other 12 subjects have lower value.},

Pn substitution from P to Sb increases D2d-type local symmetry distortions at {ZnPn}4 and {OLa}4 tetrahedra. ({LaO}){ZnP} and ({LaO}){ZnAs} exhibit direct band gaps (Γ → Γ) of 0.621 {eV} and 0.528 {eV}, respectively, while ({LaO}){ZnSb} exhibits an indirect band gap (Γ → 0.2Λ) of 0.029 {eV}. The band gaps come from valence Pn p x/p y and conduction Zn 4s states. Moreover, the substitution increases split-off energy at Z and Γ points. We find localized valence degeneracy-lifted Zn 3d states because of the possible second-order Jahn-Teller effect, which induces the local symmetry distortions. The localized Zn 3d states are followed by minor bonding s-p hybridization of Zn and Pn. Above them, we show major bonding s-p hybridization; O 2p states in electron-blocking [{LaO}]+ layers, which are essential for thermoelectricity; and nonbonding Pn p states near Fermi level. In the conduction band, antibonding s-p hybridization is found. Our result shows new insights and findings of structural and electronic properties, which explain previous experimental results, as the focus of this study is related to inorganic chemistry. This study is important for future functional device applications.},

In this experiment, structural changes in a pseudo-two-dimensional model of a granular system experiencing {BNE} were observed from the perspective of network analysis. The system consisted of 199 granular beds of 0.68 cm of diameter with a 2.5 cm diameter intruder placed in a 3mm wide double-window box that was slightly larger than the thickness of the bed and the intruder. The system was subjected to vibrations with a frequency of 13.33 Hz and an amplitude of 0.75 cm, so the {BNE} could be observed. For the purpose of the analysis, the granular beds were considered the nodes of a network and the relationships between adjacent beds (were contact force occurred) represented its edges. The analysis, consisting of image processing, network extraction, network parameters calculation and community detection, was performed using Wolfram Mathematica v. 11.3. The experiment was able to calculate the change in the network parameters including degrees, clustering coefficients, betweenness centrality, and modularity for the system with intruders and systems without intruders. The parameter values corresponding to each system were markedly different, clearly showing the influence of the intruder. The authors were also able to successfully map the evolution of the community structure in both types of granular systems one step at a time using a modularity optimization method.},

It provides a simple example of a slab geometry reactor design for fixed diameters, but the spatial meshes are varied in all region. The computation procedures to calculate the neutron flux distribution are conducted as follows: The boundary conditions of initial neutron source and neutron flux are determined. Macroscopic cross section of Uranium is regulated in homogeneous region and taken from the reference. The diffusion coefficient is arranged as fixed value. Furthermore, evaluation of numerical neutron flux value was carried out using the Jacobi method. The results show that with increasing spatial mesh, the neutron flux will decrease, but the neutron flux distribution pattern remained the same.},

The plane-wave method within the generalized gradient approximation is employed. We revisit the properties of bulk α-{PbO} system as the references. The indirect minimum bandgaps (E g ) of the bulk (1.645 {eV}, 0.2Δ → M) and bilayer systems (1.969 {eV}, 0.1Σ → Γ) become the direct E g in the monolayer system (2.53 {eV}, Γ → Γ). The E g mainly come from Pb 6p and O 2p orbital states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. The presence of valence band maximum at 0.2Δ and 0.1Σ points in the bulk and bilayer systems, respectively is induced by the Γ-point Mexican-hat dispersion, which disappears in the monolayer system. Furthermore, we find the strong van Hove singularity, which mainly comes from O 2p states, in the monolayer system. The optical properties show that the optical dichroism and dielectric constant (ε 0) of the 2D systems are higher and lower, respectively, than that of the bulk system. From the electron-energy-loss functions, the transformation of the bulk into the 2D systems can tune the energy levels of plasmonic states. We emphasize that the visible-region plasmonic states enhance in the monolayer system compared to that of the bulk system. This study opens the potential application of the 2D α-{PbO} systems in low-energy plasmonic devices.},

	abstract = {We study the effects of post-annealing treatments on excitonic states and defects of nanostructured Ti-doped {ZnO} thin films grown by room-temperature magnetron sputtering technique. Here, the as-grown samples were annealed by varying the annealing environment, time, and temperature. We found that the higher excitonic emission was at 600 °C under N2 environment for 30 min. The excitonic states are analyzed by using spectroscopic ellipsometry, photoluminescence, and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. Through critical point analysis of the complex dielectric function from spectroscopic ellipsometry, the energy of exciton is redshifted from 3.49 {eV} to 3.36 {eV} and the increase of excitonic transition is observed upon the annealing treatment. The weak excitonic transition in the as-grown sample is mainly due to the oxygen vacancies that promote electronic screening effect. The contribution of oxygen vacancies is confirmed by the presence of green luminescence (∼2.5 {eV}) and space-charge-limited current regime from electrical properties measurements. This work is very important for tunable optoelectronic devices based on the doped {ZnO} system.},

The source voltage was 65, 75, …, 115 {KV}. The consistent parameters were set at; 0.20 rotation, 13.89 µm resolution, and 1 mm aluminum. The reconstructed images were quantified in {CT} Analyser 1.16.4.1. The region of interest ({ROI}) was a circle with a diameter of 275 pixels as well as the semi-automatic threshold were drawn on the reconstructed image. Based on the Hounsfield unit ({HU}) analysis, there were three groups of urinary stone on source voltage of 85 {KV}. The first group (struvite) has consisted of stone number 1 (461.42) and 3 (489.05). The second group (cystine) has consisted of stone number 2 (55.08) and 5 (-233.41). The third group was stone number 4 (634.18). The edge detection using semi-automatic threshold can classify five urinary stones into three types; struvite, cystine, and the other group.},

These studies were undertaken for understanding the role of the A cation in their band structure and band gap energy characteristics. The calculations were initiated by finding the optimum lattice constants and the lowest total energy of these {APbBr}3 crystals. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials with {GGA}-{PBE} and {LDA}-{PZ} exchange-correlation functions have been implemented in these calculations. The computation results show that the energy gaps are not significantly affected by the variation of {APbBr}3, which are in the range of 1.708–1.769 {eV} for {GGA}-{PBE} pseudo-potentials and 1.148–1.237 {eV} for {LDA}-{PZ} pseudo-potentials. In addition, the calculated Density of States ({DOS}) indicate that the valence band is predominantly constructed by the Br− anions, while the conduction band is predominantly constructed by the Pb2+ and A+ cations. However, except for {LiPbBr}3 and {NaPbBr}3 perovskites, the A+ cations do not contribute significantly to the valence band and the lowest level of the conduction band. Moreover, the charge density distributions and Bader analysis reveal that the bonding between the A+ cation and Br− anion has a stronger ionic character than the bonding between Pb2+ cation and Br− anion, which shows partial ionic and covalent bonds character. Therefore, while their bandgap energies are merely determined by the {PbBr}6 octahedral structure as reported elsewhere, the present results may then also imply that the A+ cations are not involved significantly in the interband photoexcitation, photovoltaic and charge transport processes in these perovskites, with an exception for the {LiPbBr}3 and {NaPbBr}3 perovskites.},

The development of {EEG} device has become more advanced along with the invention of low-cost tiny electronic modules and wireless technology. This research aimed to develop a low-cost wireless modular device for brainwave acquisition based on Arduino microcontroller. The system was designed into sensor block for brainwave receiver and conditioning, and mainboard block for data processing. Dry-active electrode was developed as the sensor, followed by preamplifier module which was also installed at the sensor block. Active filter and {DRL} circuits were developed on the mainboard part. Arduino {UNO} was used as the main processor of the device. The developed modules were then evaluated using signal generator to examine the module characteristics and consistency. As the result, the preamplifier module was detected to reach 40.34 {dB} on gain ability. The cutoff frequency on the active filter module was calculated on 31 Hz. Furthermore, Arduino {UNO} was identified to have a consistency on input and output voltage.},

	abstract = {We validated the tail replacement technique in the modulation transfer function ({MTF}) calculation of {CT} images using edges of homogeneous and non-homogeneous phantom using an automated method. The algorithm for the automated {MTF} calculation consists of several steps. The upper edge of the phantom was detected from its axial image and pixel values was taken to create an edge spread function ({ESF}). The left tail of the {ESF} was flipped horizontally to replace the right tail. Differentiating the {ESF} produced a line spread function ({LSF}) which was Fourier transformed to produce the {MTF}. To validate the result for the non-homogeneous phantom was compared with that for a homogeneous phantom. Results showed that in the homogeneous module, the {MTF} curve generated without tail replacement corresponded to its shape in use. However for the non-homogeneous module, the {MTF} obtained without tail replacement differed considerably from its shape in use. The 50\% value of {MTF} ({MTF}-50) without tail replacement was 0.44 cycles/mm compared to 0.33 cycles/mm in use. Using the tail replacement, the {MTFs} in the homogeneous and non-homogeneous modules were comparable, with {MTF}-50 values of 0.33 cycles/mm for both. In summary, the {MTF} cannot be conventionally measured from the edge of the non-homogeneous module, but it can be resolved using the tail replacement technique on the {ESF} curve.},

This work aims to investigate how particle bed can support the intruder in the way similar to how buoyant force can support a floating object. The final condition of the intruder is limited to the partially floating condition since the sinking condition will give any supporting information in formulating granular buoyant force. Considered types of forces are the gravitational force, fluid buoyant force, fluid viscous force, particle- particle and particle-wall normal force with elastic and damping constants, and particle-particle binding force for the intruder. Simulation is performed using the molecular dynamics method implementing the Euler algorithm. Only one kind of parameter variation is used in this work, which is a variation of intruder particle density. As the results, it is observed that an intruder with larger particle density sinks deeper than the smaller ones, but how it floats is still inaccurate. Finally, it can be concluded that the granular buoyant force will show similar characteristics as a fluid buoyant force, but not the same due to nature of granular particles that built the system.},

We used two types of phantoms (head {CTDI} and adult anthropomorphic phantoms) and two types of detectors (pencil ionization chamber and radiophotoluminescence detectors). Measurements using the head {CTDI} phantom and pencil ionization chamber were performed at the upper peripheral hole of the {CTDI} phantom, whereas measurements using {RPL} detectors were performed on the surface of the eyes of the anthropomorphic phantom. Each measurement was performed with position phantoms at the isocenter and also at the positions ±2, ±4, and ±6 cm under and above the isocenter. The impact of miscentering on noise was also observed. Our results show that the dose to the eye decreases with increasing position of the phantoms from the isocenter, and increases with decreasing position of the phantoms from the isocenter. Miscentering above the isocenter can potentially reduce the dose to the eye lens, which is a sensitive organ to ionizing radiation.},

Both {TCP} and {NTCP} depend on fractionation and cell biological effects such as repopulation, repair, redistribution and re-oxygenation. It also depends on the statistical distribution model used. One model that can review the biological effects of cells is the Poisson model. In this research, we modified the Poisson model by considering the four biological effects mentioned above on {TCP} and only the effect of repair on {NTCP}. The objective of this research is to investigate the most dominant effect that influences {TCP} value and the effect of repair on {NTCP}. The results show that the effect of repair and repopulation cause tumor cells cannot be erased completely while the effects of resenitization (re-oxygenation and redistribution) can facilitate tumor cells to die. It can be seen that the most dominant biological effect is the repair effect on the tumor. This effect can be minimized by reducing the length of dose delivery time. Furthermore, the repair effect on normal tissue can reduce the value of {NTCP} about 9\% compared with other models. By using the {ISO}-{NTCP} curve we also get the spinal cord repair time after 15 hours.},

The {XRD} patterns and field-emission {SEM} images indicate that Tgrowth increment linearly increases the c-axis strain and average growth rate. The photoluminescence spectra show that Tgrowth increment from 298 to 373 K induces the blue-violet emission promoted by Zn interstitials (Zni). We also observe the blue emission promoted by the few O interstitials (Oi). However, this Tgrowth increment significantly reduces oxygen antisites ({OZn}) and eliminates oxygen and zinc vacancies ({VO}, {VZn}). We find that Tgrowth increment to 423 K enhances Oi and eliminates Zni inducing the excellent blue emission the O-rich condition. Notably, the point defects suppress the exciton-exciton scattering emission for Tgrowth = 373 and 423 K. Furthermore, the Kubelka-Munk spectra show that the strain provokes the free-excitonic absorption edge redshift.

Engineers need no longer rely on approximations and interpolation of chemical behaviour from idealised or simplified low-order systems. Sophisticated thermodynamic databases and dedicated thermodynamic computer platforms make it possible to predict the outcomes of complex multicomponent, multiphase reactions, and to present this information in forms that are useful for industrial practice. In the present paper a summary and review of phase equilibria data on key Cu-Fe-O-S sub-systems including Ca, Si and minor elements, is provided, as are examples of the application of thermodynamic and thermochemical calculations to the modelling of copper converting. As further information on chemical behaviour and integration with process models become available these sophisticated predictive tools and approaches will become increasingly used to improve metallurgical process design and efficiency, and to optimise the productivity of integrated copper production operations.},

Higher maximum sky brightness occurred after midnight. Brightness values before midnight were 17.83±0.83 mag/arcsec sq. on average and 18.98±0.78 mag/arcsec sq. at maximum, with average temperature of 18.8±1.3 C.

Some sunspots showed faster motion during eruptive phase at about 10\% than decay phase and they moved nearly along the magnetic field polarity inversion line that showed shear motion. Flare outburst which is occurred in corona layer affected sunspot motion and area, as seen for their changing configuration and morphology, before and after peaked X-ray intensity.

They are known as a long-standing challenge in astronomical spectroscopy because of their unknown carriers. However, they are also a potential {IS} tracers, in particular to probe distant clouds because they are not easily saturated. We devised automated {DIB}-fitting methods appropriate for cool star spectra and multiple {IS} components. The data were fitted with a combination of a synthetic stellar spectrum, a synthetic telluric transmission, and empirical {DIB} profiles. The initial number of {DIB} components and their radial velocity were guided by {HI} 21 cm emission spectrum, or, when available in the spectral range, {IS} neutral sodium ({NaI}) absorption lines. For {NaI}, radial velocities of {IS} {NaI} lines and {DIBs} were maintained linked during a global simultaneous fit. Using the tools, we have analyzed Gaia-{ESO} Survey ({GES}) spectra of stars that probe between 2-10 kpc long line-of-sight ({LOS}) in few different regions of the Milky Way (fields). For all fields, the {DIB} strength and target extinction are well correlated. We show that, toward distance-distributed target stars, {DIBs} can be used to locate dense clouds in the Galaxy (i.e., Galactic arm) and probe a {LOS} kinematical structure. In addition, we have devised the {DIB}-{DIB} global fit to study the relation between {DIBs} and can be a potential tool to trace interstellar environmental conditions.},

We present some results on the relationship between large solar coronal holes close to the central meridian and solar wind stream with the aim to analyse their geo-effectiveness. The analysis were carried out by considering geomagnetic and solar wind parameters such as total geomagnetic field, Bz component, proton density and plasma speed during Earth-side large solar coronal holes appearance.

The effects of very strong magnetic field in {AR} 12192 influences two mechanisms, flux enrichment of charge particles in lower energy and on the contrary to inhibit streaming of particles in higher energy. It is suggested that interactions of multielements of solar energetic particles with interplanetary magnetic fields and plasma speed play an important role, as seen from the variations of rollover power-law of spectral energy.},

Clusters of galaxies may be considered as self-similar, meaning that the properties of low mass clusters can be scaled up from the properties of more massive clusters, and vice versa. Clusters of galaxies have been thought to have standard mass fraction of gas, independent of their redshifts or total masses, and therefore proposed to be used as “standard buckets”.The purpose of this work is to check the validity of clusters of galaxies as standard buckets by studying larger sample than those analysed by Mantz et al. (2014). The data set employed here consists of Chandra observations of 47 relaxed clusters at redshift 0.069 ≤ z ≤ 1.063. The results of this study show that compared to the differential gas fraction (f gas,diff), the cumulative gas mass fractions (f gas,2500) of the total sample of clusters are less dependent to the total mass M 2500 and redshift. Relation between gas mass fraction and total mass M 2500 suggests that massive clusters are more reliable to be used as standard buckets.},

Among 3100 star clusters (excluding associations), there are 634 clusters considered as binary/multiple cluster candidates. In this paper, the empirical statistics of the population, including spatial, size, separation, and age distribution are constructed using updated data. The current cluster compilation includes the ages of 88\% group components, which is three times more complete compared to the previous study. From the established statistics, we found an evidence that cloud fissions become the most probable mechanism of binary star cluster formation.

By applying the specific cosmological model, we can measure a distance from the redshift. The exact redshift can only measure by using the spectroscopic technique (Doppler effect), but spectroscopic observation limited to brighter objects and numbers of objects in a single field of view ({FoV}). While photometric observation can capture fainter objects and more objects in a single {FoV}. Measurements of photometric redshift could have done by comparing the {SED} curves of the elliptical galaxy with known spectroscopic redshifts from other elliptical galaxies which we want to find the photometric redshift. Another method is to do linear or non-linear regression, by assuming the redshift is a function of magnitude in each band-pass filter. Therefore, we propose a technique that using full galaxy images in each measured bands and machine learning method for measuring photometric redshift.

	abstract = {In the standard model neutrinos consist of three species (flavors) and are massless. However, solar neutrino problem that was solved by neutrino oscillations requires that neutrinos have non-zero masses. Another support for non-zero neutrino masses comes from kinematic experiments. Oscillation experiments give rise to a further problem regarding the order of neutrino masses, known as the neutrino mass hierarchy problem, i.e. whether the hierarchy is normal or inverted. On cosmological scales, massive neutrinos affect Cosmic Microwave Background ({CMB}) and Large Scale Structure ({LSS}) formation. The impact of massive neutrinos is imprinted in the power spectrum of {CMB}, and in the {LSS} matter power spectrum as well. Since neutrinos affect events in the universe, it is possible to constrain neutrino properties based on cosmological observations. This work is aiming at constraining neutrino total mass from cosmological observations in the two hierarchy scenarios, i.e. normal and inverted hierarchies, and also at determining which neutrino mass hierarchy is favoured by cosmological observations. To constrain neutrino total mass we employed {CosmoMC} and performed Bayesian analysis with {MCMC} algorithm, while neutrino mass hierarchy was determined based on Bayes factors, in which likelihoods of the two hierarchy scenarios were compared. In addition, neutrino individual masses were estimated by combining results of oscillation experiments. Depending on the dataset used, different total mass constraints were obtained. The tightest constraint comes from a combination of {CMB} + {LSS} + {BAO} + Supernova data, i.e. Σmv {\textless} 0.183 {eV} (normal hierarchy) and Σmv {\textless} 0.188 {eV} (inverted hierarchy) with 95\% C.L. The Bayes factors analysis prefers normal hierarchy, although with weak evidence.},

Radio emission from active galactic nucleus ({AGN}) is known to be suppressing stellar growth in the most massive galaxies, thus becoming significant ingredient in modeling galaxy formation process. Radio luminosity function across cosmic redshifts (z) is an important tool to constrain the co-evolutionary models of radio {AGN} and its host galaxy. Therefore, we aim to calculate radio luminosity function at 1.4 {GHz} frequency for radio {AGN} in the range of 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 1.3 in this work. The radio data was taken from deep {VLA} observation of Stripe 82 field at angular resolution of 1.8” and 52 μJy sensitivity. On the other hand, the optical/near-infrared data was taken from Dark Energy Survey {DR}1 observation in g, r, i, z, Y bands with co-added catalog limiting magnitude of i = 23.44. We estimated the photometric redshift (photo-z) of each sources by using combined two machine learning algorithms: neural networks and boosted regression trees. We successfully performed accurate photo-z measurement with average bias 〈δ〉 = −3.5 × 10−3, scatter 〈σ〉 = 0.15 and outlier fraction 〈f(3σ)〉 = 0.06. By using 1/V max method, we calculated the luminosity function, then constrained their evolution with pure density evolution ({PDE}) or pure luminosity evolution ({PLE}) model. At median z = 0.31, 0.59, 0.88, 1.10, we found the power-law index of {PDE} is αD = 1.29, 1.43, 1.73, 0.94 while for {PLE} is αL = 2.28, 2.59, 3.19, 1.63. Our result is consistent with previous studies and gives better constraint to radio {AGN} luminosity and density evolution power-law indexes due to larger number of sources (6900) and wider covered sky fraction (92 deg2).},

In agreement with previous studies, we found that the {DIB} strength has a positive correlation with the interstellar extinction, even though significant deviations were found. The correlation study between the {DIB} strength and the extinction is limited by the fact that the 3D extinction survey in the Galaxy is incomplete. The {DIB} spatial distribution toward the South Galactic Pole indicates that the {DIB} carrier(s) are distributed similarly as other Galactic warp tracer. More data, especially {DIB} measurements from target stars above Galactic principal plane, are needed to demonstrate that {DIB} can be used as a tracer of Galactic warp.},

In recent years, surveys of {DIBs} have been conducted, but mostly focus on strong bands. In this work, we extracted and measured {DIBs} recorded in the high-resolution stellar spectra of ε Auriga (ε Aur) and {IQ} Per observed by using Gunma Astronomical Observatory Echelle Spectrograph ({GAOES}) (spectral resolution R∼65000). Observations were aimed at obtaining high resolution spectra of double-lined detached eclipsing binaries. For each selected {DIB}, we performed spectral fitting of a combination of a smooth stellar continuum (polynomial function), an empirical {DIB} model, and a synthetic telluric transmission. The high-quality data allow us to measure not only strong and well-known {DIBs}, but also weaker {DIBs}.},

Meanwhile, flare define as the increment of galactic disk scale high depends on galactocentric distance. Galactic disk tracers (dust, gaseous, and stars) can be used to explain the presence of both structures. The reddening of 10 young open clusters ({OC}) and 2985 early-type ({OB}) stars chosen in this work. Both components predicted to represent the galactic disk component where the warp and flare occurred. The Milky Way Star Cluster ({MWSC}) catalogue used to select the open clusters initial parameters. Then, we used proper motion data from {GAIA} {DR}2 combined with photometric data from Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) catalogue to determine the open cluster membership and reddening. The open cluster memberships are selected using scatter algorithm. Then, the {JHKs} photometric data used to build the Two Colour Diagram ({TCD}) and Colour-Magnitude Diagram ({CMD}). We selected the reddening of {OB} stars data from Tycho 2 catalogue. The result is an increment of colour excess depends on galactocentric distance.

The observed spectra showed a strong Hα emission line and multiple emission lines of Fe {II} multiplets, which is typical for a Fe {II} type nova. However, since {ASASSN}-17hx was classified as a He/N type only few days after its outburst, it is suggested that the nova is actually a hybrid type nova.

The research produces tens of thousands of data for each month such that proper handling, processing and analysing the data become challenging. In this article, we demonstrate an alternative method for processing the {NSB} data by utilising pattern recognition techniques: Canny edge detection and Hough transform. These techniques were applied to identify data and extract important parameter from the {NSB} density plot semi-automatically. Datasets collected from Bandung, Garut, Subang and Sumedang used as the test cases. Three time-segments (dusk, night and dawn) became the main focus of the analyses and our method successfully extracted following parameters: the rate of sky brightness change at dusk and dawn, the average {NSB} at night and the intersections which indicate transition time. This method, along with its many possible improvements, enables us to process data more effectively and encourage more observation campaigns to be conducted in the future.},

The similarity on the central stars composition of O(He) and {IC} 4663 provides evidence for evolutionary sequence [{WN}] → O(He). Evolution of {CSPN} {IC} 4663 followed evolution low-mass star, but experienced born-again scenario when it enters white dwarf phase. So it goes back to Asymptotic Giant Branch ({AGB}) phase. To investigate central star properties, the nebula and its evolutionary status, we constructed the spectral energy distribution ({SED}) model by using photoionization code {CLOUDY} based on data set from optic to far-{IR} wavelength (∼3 – 100 μm) and include the Postdam Wolf-Rayet ({PoWR}) stellar model atmosphere. The comparison between the nebular abundances from photoionization model result and {AGB} model gives initial 3M ⊙ star with Z = 0.02.

	abstract = {Bosscha Observatory is the largest and oldest observatory in Indonesia that has been actively doing astronomical research since 1928. Bosscha Observatory was originally very suitable for observing astronomical objects because of its ideal night sky conditions and covered most of the northern and southern sky areas. However, starting at the end of 1980, the quality of the night sky at Bosscha Observatory has decreased along with the development of cities around the observatory. Therefore, the construction of a new observatory in Indonesia is currently underway, i.e. the Timau National Observatory. One of the main causes of the decreasing quality of the night sky at Bosscha Observatory is light pollution. Light pollution is one form of pollution caused by excessive light outside the room released into the sky, causing an increase in brightness of the night sky. The brightness increasing of the night sky causes relatively faint astronomical object, e.g. Milky Way Galaxy that is difficult to observe. Based on the analysis of the dynamics of light pollution in a radius of 20 km from Bosscha Observatory and at a radius of 90 km from the Timau National Observatory in 2013-2017 using {VIIRS}-{DNB} satellite imagery, it is known that there is a wide change in light pollution for the very low, low, medium, high, and very high. The average area of light pollution at a radius of 20 km from Bosscha Observatory for the category of very low, low, medium, high, and very high categories experienced a rate of -41.3 ± 135.2 km2 / year, 5.9 ± 97.2 km2 / year, 15.1 ± 14.6 km2 / year, 18.0 ± 42.6 km2 / year, and 2.1 ± 10.2 km2 / year. The rate of increase in the extent of light pollution for the medium, high, and very high categories occurs south of the Bosscha Observatory, which is towards the city of Bandung. The average area of light pollution in a 90 km radius from the Timau National Observatory for the very low, low, medium, and high categories experienced a rate of 20.8 ± 43.4 km2 / year, -22.1 ± 40.9 km2 / year, 3.0 ± 7.3 km2 / year, and -1.7 ± 7.3 km2 / year. Therefore, the night sky in the 128-268 degrees azimuth direction at Bosscha Observatory is relatively not ideal as a location for observing astronomical objects, and the Timau National Observatory is still relatively ideal as a location for observing astronomical objects, but it is necessary to monitor the dynamics of light pollution in the direction of 207-215 degrees azimuth which leads to Kupang City.},

The secondary star is embedded in the accretion disk produced by the infalling matter from the primary star, and this disk is estimated as the source of the emission lines. The observations were conducted at Bosscha Observatory, Lembang, Indonesia from May to August 2018, using 10” Meade {LX}-200R Telescope (D = 254 f/D = 9.84), equipped with a Littrow High Resolution Spectrograph ({LHIRES}) {III}, grating of 1200 grooves/mm yielding in the resolution of R∼5900, and {CCD} {SBIG} {ST}-402 {XME} camera with backfocus at 17.5 mm. Seeing during observation was estimated to be 2 arc seconds. During this period, we have obtained 15 spectra in various wavelength coverage, 4 spectra covering around λλ = 5779 – 6046 ÅÅ (typical S/N = 0.02), 1 spectrum covering around λλ = 6430.257 – 6694.434 ÅÅ (typical S/N = 0.06), and 10 spectra covering around λλ = 6487 – 6752 ÅÅ (typical S/N = 0.06). The observed spectra show Hα-emission profiles with V/R variation, He I 6678 Å with P-Cygni profiles, and He I 5876 Å with P-Cygni profiles. These variations are due to the fact that β Lyrae is a binary star system, and also it is suspected that another possible mechanism might be involved.},

	abstract = {Observations showed that there are star clusters in paired condition, called as binary star cluster. Some statistical studies attempted to identify the existence of binary and multiple clusters in our Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds. {MIStiX} survey also found that most of embedded younger star clusters (a few Myr) have clumpy structures, indicating star distribution in young clusters cannot be simply described as spherical shape. This structure can be the key-factor of the formation of primordial binary cluster in our Galaxy. In this work, we simulate the formation of binary star cluster from fractal distribution in isolated condition and under Galactic tidal field for 50 Myr. This aims to investigate the most probable condition to let the highly formation of binary star cluster in our Galaxy and the role of Galactic tidal field in that formation. We find that the clumpier structure of star cluster, the number of binary/multiple cluster will increase, and the same condition also occurs for the warmer condition or higher αvir (the kinetic to potential energy ratio). But this number will decrease at larger time due to the merger processes between the star clusters. By these arguments, we conclude that the most probable condition of star cluster to let the highly formation of binary star cluster is the one with highly sub structured and warm condition. For such condition of star cluster, the fraction of binary/multiple in our Galaxy is 0.87 ± 0.06 at time 20 Myr and decreases to be 0.63 ± 0.09 at time 50 Myr, with reduction 0.24 ± 0.08. As comparison, this reduction is only 0.07 ± 0.05 for the same condition in isolated. The higher deflation shows that the Galactic tidal field has important role in the formation of binary star cluster, as well as the initial mass of star cluster. And we suggest the discovery of multiple clusters in this work is interesting to learn more deeply in the future work.},

	abstract = {The differential rotation is the result of the interaction between rotation and convection and causes dynamo circulation that affect the cycle of solar activity. Tracer method using features in the photosphere such as sunspot is a simple method to measure the differential rotation. In this study, 98 individual sunspots on January 8 - 22, 2013 and August 25 - September 7, 2013 were used to measure the differential rotation of the Sun. The Sun’s continuum images were obtained from {HMI} (Helioseismic Magnetic Imager) instrument at {SDO} (Solar Dynamic Observatory). Coordinate and area of sunspot were measured using {ImageJ} software and converted to Carrington coordinates. From the measurement, we derived the differential rotation equation, the relation of velocity and area of sunspot, and the relation of sunspot’s velocity and Zurich classification. The differential rotation equation obtained in this study is ω (B) = (14.376 ± 0.04) + (0.6 ± 0.38) sin2B (°/day). For the relation between velocity and area of sunspot, we got the sidereal rotation rate of sunspots with area 100 pixels2.},

Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis ({EPMA}) was used to measure major and minor element concentrations in the matte, slag, and solid phases. The experimentally-determined distribution coefficient of As between slag and matte was found to decrease with decreasing P({SO}2) from log L = 0.5 at P({SO}2) = 25 {kPa} to approximately log L = −4.0 at lowest P({SO}2), corresponding to metal saturation. Thermodynamic model parameters describing As distribution have been derived based on the present and previous data on the slag/matte, slag/metal, and slag/matte/metal equilibria. The thermodynamic model can be used for the evaluation of distribution of As between phases in the high-temperature pyrometallurgical production and refining of copper.},

This detection allows us to study {DIBs} in fullerene-rich space environment. In this work, we study the presence of {DIBs} in central star of planetary nebulae ({CSPN}) by using archival data of optical spectra observed with 8.1-m Gemini South Telescope and Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs ({GMOS}, spectral range of 3900 Å - 5900 Å and resolution of R ∼ 2300) and also from 2.5-m Isaac Newton Telescope with {IDS} spectrograph (R ∼ 2300). We measured the equivalent width of 4430, 5870 and 6283 Å {DIB} by fitting the detected {DIB} profile with the empirical template derived from higher resolution data. We investigated 4430, 5870 and 6283 Å {DIBs} in the spectra of {CSPN} and their correlation with the colour excess (E(B-V)). The correlation between the {DIB} strength and E(B-V) has positive value.

Addition of magnetic field contribution to the rotation curves of spiral galaxies has been proposed in some literature to explain the rising features. In this work we investigated the rotation curves of three spiral galaxies, i.e. {NGC} 2841, {NGC} 6946, and M 31, whose profiles of azimuthal magnetic field are available in literature.

This study conducts a modelling of the phenomenon happening on the surface of an asteroid for mimicking the concept of {BNE}. Physical parameters used in this study follow a model of a common asteroid. The very first step of the modelling is to generate an initial condition of particles. Then, these particles are dropped into the surface of an asteroid model. After these particles reached the dynamical relaxation, the additional force will be added into the system which is represented by some sinusoidal oscillation formulas. Modelling the concept of {BNE} which only involves collisions of inter-particles and gravity factor indicates that the rising of bigger boulders to come up to the surface is likely to occur. Nevertheless, there are many other parameters that have a role in the low-gravity environment and need to be explored more.},

Stars like α Tau are interested to be investigated in order to learn and understand how their evolution processes at the next stage, i.e. Asymptotic Giant Branch ({AGB}) stage. At {AGB} stage, a star will suffer stronger oscillations with larger radius than {RGB} stage. This stage is important because it will be the key-factor on most recent observational data, and Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics ({MESA}) and {SPECTRUM} packages to compute accurate physical parameters and atmospheric models of α Tau at {AGB} stage. Our computational results show that α Tau will be an {AGB} star with M = (1.52 ± 0.07) M⊙, Teff = (4545 ± 18) K, and log L = (1.98 ± 0.07) L⊙ at age (2.11 ± 0.27) Gyr. Its radius at this stage is determined to be log R = (1.20 ± 0.92) R⊙. Mass loss at the initial of this stage is still small, i.e. (2.07 ± 0.09) × 10–10 M⊙/yr and it will increase during this stage. The core at this stage contains carbon and oxygen with C/O ∼ 0.26 which shows that α Tau will be type M-{AGB}. Atmospheric model of α Tau at {AGB} stage shows that this star will have higher effective temperature and gas pressure than at {RGB} stage. These conditions will cause the increasing of electron density and Rosseland absorption coefficient in its atmosphere. The hotter atmosphere of {AGB} stage causes its peak of continuum shifts toward smaller wavelength and yields in three times higher intensity than at {RGB} stage.},

This kind of perturbation can induce the cometary showers in our Solar System. In this work, we attempt to make numerical simulations to trace the orbit of stars which close encounter with our Sun in the cases of Milky Way’s axisymmetric only and with non-axisymmetric potentials. We have 306 selected solar neighborhood stars from {GAIA} {DR}2, {LAMOST} {DR}4, and {RAVE} {DR}5 which have highly precise kinematics. In this work, we find a few stars that have counter parameter (dm ) less than or equal to 2 pc in both of past and future close encounters with the Sun. We also find a few stars ({ID} 283, 290, 297, 298) even with dm ≤ 0.5 pc within their errors, for past close encounters at time tm ≥ 0.5 Myr ago. These stars should have perturbed the Oort Cloud’s stability long time ago. Furthermore, we find a few stars ({ID} 293, 299, 300) with dm ≤ 1 pc within their errors, at tm {\textgreater} 0.6 Myr for future close encounters. Besides that,cadding non-axisymmetric component of Milky Way does not change the results. This suggests that the non-axisymmetric component of Milky Way potential has small effect in perturbing the orbital motion of stars for short timescale. That’s why the values of dm are relatively similar within their errors, for both cases of the Milky Way potential.},

	abstract = {Assessment of literature data, experimental study and thermodynamic modeling of the Pb-As and Cu-Pb-As systems are presented. These chemical systems are of importance for metallic lead refining at 330-500 °C (603-773 K), and for separation of copper from lead in complex polymetallic processes at 1000-1150 °C (1273-1423 K). Few studies are available for the solubility of solid copper arsenide in lead at low temperature. At high temperature, significant discrepancies between available experimentally measured limits of two-liquid miscibility gap exist in the Cu-Pb-As system. Experimental investigation of the present study aimed to fill the gaps and resolve the discrepancies. It consists of equilibration, quenching and electron probe microanalysis. Thermodynamic modeling helped to analyze the results and provided a database of model parameters. Present study is a part of a larger research program aimed at characterization of phase equilibria, heat balance and distribution of elements during complex copper and lead smelting, refining and recycling.},

Assuming that the clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium, masses can be estimated from temperature and density profiles of the clusters. In order to produce temperature and density profiles we performed data reduction, spectrum extraction, fitting of multiple observational spectra, and deprojection procedures. Density and temperature profiles were fitted with a single beta model and an exponential model respectively. We determined masses of the clusters enclosed by R2500, which is the radius where the density equals to 2500 times the critical density of the universe. We compare our results with other mass determinations employing different methods, i.e. Sunyaev Zeldovich Effect ({SZE}) and lensing, where available and found that within uncertainties they are in a good agreement.},

X-ray spectra of {ULXs} have been investigated in many previous studies. However, sparse observations render it more difficult to convincingly distinguish between two competing scenarios, i.e. sub-critical accreting intermediate-mass black hole and super-critical accreting stellar remnant black hole. Here, we report our investigation of a sample of nearby {ULXs}, as well as their host galaxies, in order to get a more complete understanding of their nature. Multiwavelength analysis was applied to study these {ULXs}. From X-ray study, we found that most {ULXs} in our sample do exhibit spectral variability in which higher energy X-ray predominates the spectra as the source becomes brighter. We also compiled some properties of the host galaxies, as a proxy of {ULX} environment. We found that {ULXs} in our sample can neither be exclusively associated with a certain type of morphology, nor with high nuclear activity. We also found that 12 out of 19 {ULXs} reside in host galaxies with star formation rate of less than 1 solar mass per year.},

In this modeling use Finite Difference Time Domain ({FDTD}) method because it can solve electromagnetic field interaction problem and to analyze the transient electromagnetic method compared to the frequency domain. The first step in this method is positioning of the cell to the lines of the magnetic fields that surround normal electric field line, so that this condition is suitable with the components of curl operation of Ampere’s law. Conclusion of this modeling results indication that utilizing {TDEM} method in the exploration activities is very essential and useful to map the resistivity distribution in the layered Earth.

The projectile motion is tracked using a video camera connected to a computer. The trajectory of the motion is then simulated with the help of the spreadsheet, and the air drag constant is adjusted to fit the observed data. The minimum error is used as the criteria for the best fitted air drag constant. Three types of projectiles, i.e.: conical, round, and cylindrical shape, are used in this experiment.

In this paper, the phenomenon of stenosis inhibited blood flow is simulated and observed using the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit Method. The simulation was built using the Navier-Stokes equation. This simulation does not use data with quantitative units because it only aims to observe the phenomenon of blockage of stenosis in the bloodstream, so the value was obtained without units. The velocity profile of the blood particles which are located between the rigid stenosis will be fastest if the percentage of stenosis is higher. The velocity profile shows a fluctuation in the direction of the radial position = 0 when the horizontal position is 1.5 ⩽ x ⩽ 2.5 with the maximum velocity when the stenosis is 60\% i.e 9.2 units. This shows that there are obstacles that cause the velocity profile to be higher than the blood flow without stenosis, and the greater the percentage of stenosis, the greater the fluctuations occurring in the area so that it has a higher velocity.},

In this study, we explored an alternative option to support the aforementioned application, using lava flow type igneous rock samples from the Ijen Volcanic Complex, East Java, Indonesia. We have investigated the preferred rock pore orientations from micro-computed tomography (\&mu;{CT}) images and quantified their directions. We then calculated their correlation with {AMS} data by calculating the angle between preferred pore orientation. The axis with the smallest gap to the preferred pore orientation of each sample was assumed to imply lava flow direction. Different lava flow direction preferences were obtained from different magnetic ellipsoids. Another important factor for consideration is the relative vertical position of the sampling site within a single lava flow unit. Only one out of five samples ({ANY}2) show good quantitative conformity between {AMS} data, preferred pore orientation, and topographical slope, despite these limitations. Our results point to a direction that seems to be correct and coherent on a physical basis. Additional research would likely clarify the issues involved.

Measurement of contact angle of fluid with variation of salinity, i.e.: 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M, and 5M is carried out by recording a single droplet placed on a rock surface. Each frame of the recorded video are then analysed using image processing technique to detect the edge and calculate the contact angle.

It is obtained that on preparatory glass, the higher the molarity, the longer the droplet will evaporated. On the sandstone surface, fluid contact angle on sandstone surface is about 80° and decreases with time with different trend of decrement.

	abstract = {The seismoelectric phenomenon describes generation of electromagnetic fields when seismic wave passes through fluid saturated porous media. Discovered in the 1930s, the seismoelectric effect have gained attention only in the last few decades as a tool of great potential in geophysical applications. Despite some usage in mineral exploration and ground water flow, routine field applications of this phenomenon are still under development. Nevertheless, recent advancements show great potential of the seismoelectric method in the oil and gas industry. It is now known that several rock and fluid properties affect the seismoelectric response, hence application of this response may be used for reservoir characterization, subsurface imaging and mapping, and monitoring fluid propagation through a reservoir. In this paper, we numerically studied the prospect of monitoring foam propagation through a reservoir using the seismoelectric phenomenon. The reservoir model used in the study was developed using real field data. The virtual pilot area comprised of a cross-well domain between injector well and producer well, where pre-generated foam was continuously injected into the reservoir for the period of 150 days. The seismoelectric data acquisition was modeled in the domain, where the seismic source was deployed in the injection well, and the receiving stations were installed in production well accordingly. The results of the seismoelectric surveys, with interval of 30 days, produced both seismic and seismoelectric signals received by the stations. The processed data, coupled with the average seismic velocity and arrival times of the seismoelectric conversions, were analyzed with regard to determining the locations of the displacing foam front. Subsequent comparison and analysis showed high accuracy match and consistency between the true front positions obtained from the reservoir simulator and the determined locations produced using the seismoelectric method. Additionally, to demonstrate how the seismoelectric signals can be processed in field trials, we applied noise to the same synthetic data used to estimate the foam front positions. We observed that the occurrence of the seismoelectric signal was imperceptible due to the prevailing noise. Subsequently, we applied a filtering method to reduce the effect of the noise that showed great results in uncovering the presence of the seismoelectric conversion in the electrogram while preserving amplitudes and time arrivals of the seismoelectric, seismic and co-seismic signals. According to the obtained findings, we can state that later computations of locating the foam front would yield results with the same accuracy as the noise-free synthetic signals.},

To reduce the complexity of the calculations introduced by 3-D models, iterative forward calculation of {MT} response functions is used as basis for inversion of 3-D {MT} data. This paper proposes an alternative procedure for making reliable 3-D {MT} modeling codes for forward calculation that is not only effective but also accurate. This is accomplished by using a direct method to solve the linear systems arising from the discretization process in the vector finite element approach. The vector finite element method is known for its capability of overcoming difficulties in modeling caused by possible jumps of normal components across discontinuities of material properties. Meanwhile, by using a direct method rather than an iterative method, the process of solving the linear equations does not suffer from slow convergence. Here, we present a comparison between our modeling codes and codes based on a different approach. In the resulting 3-D {MT} responses it was found that the proposed method has high accuracy.},

The study is motivated by the treatment of mud-flow in east Java, Indonesia. A Lattice Boltzmann based simulation is used for the fluid flow. In order to include interaction with moving solid, the Lattice-Boltzmann method is coupled with Immersed Boundary method (usually termed as {IBLBM}) with modified spreading operator. We use a coupling procedure where the immersed boundary forces are computed directly from the macroscopic velocity. Two different initial configurations are considered here. In the first configuration, the two disks are initially leveled and separated horizontally by a distance of 2D where D is the diameter of the disks. We then show the dynamics of the second one where the two disks are initially separated horizontally by a distance of 2D and vertically by a distance of D. Presenting a Poiseuille-like counter-flow in the first configuration only causes the two disks to have settling trajectories closer to the walls, i.e. the left (right) disk settles closer the left (right) wall. In the latter case, there exists an alternating close-encounter. Our results show that increasing the strength of the counter-flow does not mean that a close-encounter takes place earlier, i.e. there is rather a minimum value.},

In this analysis, the method is directly applied to the pore structure itself as well as the skeleton of the pores which represent the essential structure of the pore. The method is applied to four simple models of pores with different complexity levels, both the actual pore structure and the skeleton, to determine the effect of complexity to the tortuosity. The analysis is the applied on a digital sample of porous rock model with the size of 256 × 256 pixels. The interconnected pore for both the actual pore structure and the skeleton representation is traced by the Simple Neurite Tracer method.

Sedimentary rock modelling is a process of generating a digital sedimentary rock model using numerical methods which resembles the ideas and processes of natural sedimentary rock formation. One of the most important physical characteristics in generating the model is how the pore structure is affected by overlap degree among each grain. The overlap degree simulates the output of compaction process in natural sedimentary rock formation. The approach to implement such idea is by using spherical grains so that the degree of overlap could exactly be determined quantitatively. Stochastic method is used in the algorithm to map each grain positions based on a desired range of overlap degree. From previous trials it shows that higher overlap degree produces lower porosity. The algorithm is implemented in generating two dimensional cross sections of the model as well as in generating three-dimensional structure. Characteristics of pore structure are analyzed for various modelling parameters to obtain better understanding of the modelling nature.},

Fractal dimension is obtained by means of the box counting method. Interconnected pore in 3D porous media are identified by applying cubical random walk in three different directions. The complexity of the interconnected pore is then described means of tortuosity, which is defined as the ratio between geodesic lengths of the interconnected pore to the sidelength of the medium.

The correlation coefficient obtained from the samples are 0.1999, 0.3962, 0.9012 and 0.5682. Based on the results 3D fractal dimension shows a positive correlation with average tortuosity for each different porosity.

This research has never been done before. This study was divided into several main stages consist of elastic anisotropy measurements on a cube-shaped specimen to determine the direction of maximum velocity and elastic anisotropy parameter values, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility measurements on six cylindrical specimens to determine the direction of maximum susceptibility (magnetic mineral orientation) and {AMS} parameter values, petrography analysis on the all sides of the cube in order to observe preferred orientation in mineral and μ{CT} analysis in a cylindrical specimen to determine the pore trend of rock. This study showed the relationship between {AMS} and elastic anisotropy in {MR}1 sample which indicated by positive correlation between the direction of maximum susceptibility and maximum velocity. Based on the results, {MR}1 sample has elastic anisotropy degree ranges from 2,6 \% - 6,6 \% for P waves and 2,2 \% - 4 \% for S waves and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility degree around 2,6 \% - 5,4 \%. The integration of all measurement results including the direction of maximum velocity, direction of maximum susceptibility, preferred orientation in mineral, pore trend, and dip direction of sheeting joint indicate preferred orientation in {MR}1 sample towards {NE}-{SW}. One possible cause of such preferred orientation is the direction of the lava flow. Further studies in this topic are needed to support this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Characteristics of an armchair graphene nanoribbon tunnel field effect transistor ({AGNRTFET}) were modeled quantum mechanically. The transport equation in the {AGNR}-{TFET} was solved by using the Dirac-like equation. The potential profile in the {AGNR}-{TFET} was determined by solving the Dirac-like equation and the self-consistent Poisson equation. The transfer matrix method ({TMM}), as a numerical approach, and the Landauer formula were used to calculate the electron transmittance and the tunneling current respectively. The threshold voltage of the device was around 0.01 V. The effect of the {AGNR}-{TFET}’s geometry, i.e. width and length of {AGNR} and oxide thickness, on the tunneling current and the subthreshold swing was also analyzed. It was found that the tunneling current increased with an increase of the width of the {AGNR} and the oxide thickness while increasing the length of the {AGNR} made the tunneling current decrease. According to the simulation results, the subthreshold swing of the device can achieve 5 {mV}/dec. Moreover, the {AGNRTFET} geometry affects the subthreshold swing of the device.},

Porous rock images used in this study consists of generated numerically artificial rock models and real rocks images taken from micro-{CT}-scan. Random consolidation processes are applied to generate artificial rocks for different porosity. The porous media is then saturated by fluid and physical properties are calculated at each degree of fluid saturation. Influence of fluid saturation degree on electric and elastic properties of both porous media is analyzed. The results show that fluid saturation changes electric and elastic properties of rocks. Fluid conductivity has quite significant influence on the resistivity. Electrical properties decrease rapidly until 20\% of fluid saturation and only slight change for higher saturation. Bulk modulus increases for higher saturation.},

	abstract = {Micro-{CT} scanner with a resolution of about 5 micrometers is one of the modalities used to create 3 Dimensional (3D)/ 2D images of urinary stones. The purpose of this research was to optimize imaging parameters in micro-{CT} scanner based on the signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) of urinary stones for analysis of stone composition. Eight micro-{CT} scanning protocols were applied to five urinary stones taken from different patients. Each scanning protocol had different voltage, current, and exposure parameters. In the process, the projection images of the scanning protocols were reconstructed by using the same parameters. The reconstructed images were analysed based on the image brightness and {SNR}. The optimize imaging parameters which were chosen were that having high {SNR} because the high-quality image has high {SNR}. The result shows that two groups of urinary stones have the same mean {HU} value in the 3rd scanning protocols (65 {kV}; 123 µA; and 850 ms). Group one (stone number 1, 3, and 4) has mean {HU} value 790, 760, and 720, respectively. The second group (stone number 2 and 5) has mean {HU} value -514 and -343, respectively. The imaging parameters (75 {kV}; 106 µA; 600 ms) has high {SNR} (25 - 34) for the first group. The {SNR} (12.8 - 13.25) was for the second group at imaging parameters (85 {kV}; 94 µA; 500 ms). Based on the {SNR}, the two optimize imaging parameters for first and second group were 75 {kV}; 106 µA; 600 ms and 85 {kV}; 94 µA; 500 ms, respectively.},

The aim of this study was to describe multistage measurements of both the wetting and the drying front scheme of one-dimensional infiltration at laboratory scale. A soil-column infiltration apparatus was built consisting of a double acrylic wall, a sensor set and a light bulb. Acrylic was chosen as the material for the wall to minimize possible heat conduction on the wall side, which was wrapped in double insulation to achieve adiabatic condition. The following three main sensors were used and controlled by a microcontroller: water-content, pressure and temperature sensors. Meanwhile, the light bulb at the top of the apparatus was set to non-isothermal condition. The instrument was successfully built to describe vertical water movement. Slight modifications were carried out to ensure more precise observation. This resulted in the initiating of new shape interpretation based on the water-ponding measurement to refine the simplified pattern that was introduced by the conventional Green-Ampt theory.},

Furthermore, characteristics of pores formed in concrete may vary, such as in shape, in size, in volume, and/or in its orientation tendencies. These characteristics also depend on the ingredient materials and the concrete casting process. In this research, three types of concrete in a form of cylindrical sample were analysed in order to investigate their pore structure characteristics. The first type of specimen is a core sample taken from a beam of an existing reinforced concrete structure building. It has 18 {MPa} of compressive strength. For the second type, an instant concrete with 40 {MPa} of designed compressive strength and 9 cm of slump test was chosen. The third sample is a concrete with Oil Palm Shell ({OPS}) as coarse aggregate substitution with 17 {MPa} of compressive strength. These three kinds of sample were scanned with a Bruker Micro-{CT} {SkyScan} 1173 device. The scanning process produced a set of projection images which were then reconstructed to obtain three-dimensional digital grayscale images. The pores inside the concrete sample are detected as dark pixels, which represent low-density structure. Based on the detected pores, the characteristics such as the volume distribution, the size distribution, the spatial distribution, as well as several structural descriptors such as shape, orientation and eccentricity of the pores were analysed. This study concludes that the type of aggregate greatly influences the characteristics of the pore formed in a concrete.},

Currently, the ground penetrating radar ({GPR}) method is widely accepted to apply in such a case. In this study we propose an alternative method in analyzing hydrocarbon leakage absorbed by soil. For years, local people operate this artisanal oil field and they often pour in the unused oil waste into the ground. Discrete measurements of electrical conductivity of core samples were conducted using Decagon {EM} 50 instrument. The samples were taken from an artisanal oil field near a state-owned oil field located in Central Java. The hydrocarbon-contaminated soils were compared to those taken from uncontaminated soils in the same area. Depth of the coring is 70 cm and it was sampled at every 5 cm to obtain its conductivity values. The natural-uncontaminated soils showed a maximum value of 0.65 {dS}/cm at 22 cm deep whereas the maximum conductivity value of the contaminated soil samples is 1.4 {dS}/cm at 31 cm deep. The results of this study indicate that the electrical conductivity values of the contaminated soils increase in contrast to what is expected where the introduction of hydrocarbon into soil will tend to decrease its electrical conductivity value since hydrocarbon is highly resistive. These results suggest that biodegradation may have been occurring in the contaminated soils for a considerably length of time},

Self-similarity is a characteristic of fractals which shows that fractals consist of similarly shaped parts at each scale and produced the same 3D fractal dimension. 3D pigeon-hole models with self-similarity principle in structure and substructure (level 0, 1, 2) were constructed. Nine 3D rock models were generated with the size of 210 × 210 × 210 pixels and porosity of 30\%. For each complexity levels (0, 1, 2), the grains were varied to have a size (radius) of 6-10 pixels, 11-15 pixels, and 16-20 pixels. The average correlation coefficient of 3D fractal dimension results obtained for 3D pigeon-hole model similar with 3 different range of radius for level 0, 1, 2 is 0.921. Based on the level of pigeon-hole produced on the model, the fractal dimension is increases as level increases, and it is found consistent in each radius range. The avarage correlation coefficient of 3D fractal dimension obtained for 3D pigeon-hole model for level 0, 1, 2 in three diferent radius range is 0.990. Based on the radius range on the model, the fractal dimension is decreases as radius range increases, and it is found consistent in each level of pigeon-hole. As a conclusion, based on these result 3D pigeon-hole model can be considered as fractal rock model based on its self-similarity both in similary structure and substructure and its fractal dimension and grain shape model that close to rock grains.

Tortuosity was calculated by finding the path at 26 neighboring pixels and the permeability was calculated by simulating a steady state fluid flow. The result is the greater the distance between the radiation source and the object, the smaller the resolution of the image.

In this study, a three-dimensional {DC} resistivity forward modeling scheme was developed using the finite element method. The finite element equations were obtained using a weakened form of the weighted-residual method called the Galerkin method. Discretization of the modeling domain was carried out by dividing it into smaller three-dimensional blocks and subdividing each block into five tetrahedral elements. A linear interpolation function was employed and elemental linear equations were set up, followed by formation of global matrix systems of equation and incorporation of proper boundary conditions. The conjugate gradient method was applied to solve the global system of equations, which in this study was proven to be more efficient than a direct solver, contributing to a 67\% time reduction. Using a Wenner array configuration, comparison with theoretical calculation of the electric potential for a homogeneous model yielded a relative error of 3.66\%. To confirm the applicability of this forward modeling scheme, apparent resistivity profiles for several basic three-dimensional subsurface resistivity models were compared with the analytical profiles, yielding an acceptable level of fitting.},

	abstract = {In oil and gas production, only about 5\% to 20\% of hydrocarbons can be released through production wells with natural reservoir pressure. In the oil and gas industry, there is a method called enhanced oil recovery ({EOR}) to remove hydrocarbons trapped in rock pores. {EOR} is not easy and expensive, so fluid flow modeling and simulation are required to reduce the cost. In fluid modeling, there is a continuous approach using the Navier-Stokes ({NS}) equation. Not only the continuous approach, but fluid modeling also can be done by using Molecular Dynamics ({MD}) approach. Between these two methods, there is a method that bridging the advantages between the two. This method uses a macroscopic and microscopic approach (mesoscale) called Lattice Boltzmann Method ({LBM}). With this approach, the results obtained are quite accurate without the use of high computing devices. The {LBM} used in this research is the Rothman-Keller ({RK}) / color gradient method. This method assumes that the interaction force between two fluids is directly proportional to the two-fluid density ratio and has two collision operators, {BGKW} operator, and perturbation operator. This method is then subjected to pressure on the boundary region introduced by Zou-He. Then the temperature is given linearly and be used to calculate body force due to the temperature gradient. This study shows that the model that has been made is successfully simulating the flow of multiphase fluid in rock pores. In the model viscosity as a function of the temperature found that the average velocity of the fluid flow decreases when the temperature increase. In the temperature gradient model, when the temperature gradient increases, the average velocity, and saturation of the wetting fluid increases.},

Rock models were made with porosities ranging from 0.1 to 1 with increasing of value 0.1. The selected N is N = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 125 and for every N there are 10,000 random configurations. Then, tortuosity was calculated using a nearest-neighbor sites method with 6 neighboring sides. In addition, with the site percolation model, percolation probability was calculated by determining the comparison between the number of percolate configurations and the total number of configurations created. The results show that in large-size rock models, the average tortuosity will increase. Further, the percolation probability is zero at a small porosity and rises to 1 as the porosity increases. Moreover, the slope of the percolation probability curve will increase for the larger model. In other words, the larger the size of the model, the percolation threshold will become larger or more difficult to percolate for small porosity.},

We settle the quasi-adiabatic spin dynamics ({QASD}) by adding the regularization terms to the original Hamiltonian and accelerate it with use of a large time-scaling factor which realizes {QASD} on shortened time scale. Assuming the candidate regularization Hamiltonian consisting of three-body interactions besides the pair-wise exchange interactions and magnetic field, we solved the regularization terms. These terms multiplied by the velocity function give rise to the statedependent counter-diabatic terms ({CDTs}) for each of adiabatic states. Our fast forward Hamiltonian proves to generate the plural number of state-dependent {CDTs} due to the driving three-body interactions. Applying this scheme to a simple transverse Ising model, we find 2 {CDTs} which contains both two-body and three body interaction. The driving two and three-body interaction in the fast-forward scheme guarantees the complete fidelity of accelerated states.},

Gravitational fields, on the other hand, may propagate in the full space, the bulk. Some of the models could explain the weakness of the gravitational force relative to the other fundamental forces of nature. Among various models, the Randall-Sundrum ({RS}) model, an N = 1 braneworld model, has attracted much attention. Unfortunately, the assumption that standard model particles are trapped on the {RS} brane is not fully fulfilled. Accordingly, one of us with other colleagues proposed a modified {RS} model. The new model is conformally flat space-time and has much better localization properties. However, it is still not a perfect braneworld model since matter fields in some configurations are not localizable. This paper will elaborate localization properties of the model and discussed possible further modification to have a perfect model in terms of localization properties.},

However, the proposed models have not yet included the driving force depicting the external perturbation used in the experiment such as laser in 2D spectroscopy involved in the detection of the exciton transfer or an artificial quantum transport experiments. Here, we resolve this issue by subjecting the dephasing assisted transport model by Plenio and Huelga [New J. Phys. 10, 11 (2012)] to a driving force.

	abstract = {We propose a scheme of the fast forward of adiabatic spin dynamics in a triangular 3 spin cluster of quantum annealing model and reveal the structure and role of driving pair-wise interaction and three-body interactions. We settle the quasi-adiabatic spin dynamics ({QASD}) by adding the regularization terms to the original Hamiltonian and accelerate it with use of a large time-scaling factor which realizes {QASD} on shortened time scale. Assuming the candidate regularization Hamiltonian consisting of three-body interactions besides the pair-wise exchange interactions and magnetic field, we solved the regularization terms. These terms multiplied by the velocity function give rise to the state-dependent counter-diabatic terms ({CDTs}) for each of adiabatic states. Applying this method to quantum annealing model, we find {CDTs} which include pair-wise interaction and the 3-body interactions. The driving pairwise and three-body interaction in the fast-forward scheme guarantees the complete fidelity of accelerated states.},

	abstract = {The fast-forward scheme of adiabatic quantum dynamics is applied to finite regular spin clusters with various geometries and the nature of driving interactions is elucidated. Fast forward is the quasiadiabatic dynamics guaranteed by regularization terms added to the reference Hamiltonian, followed by a rescaling of time with the use of a large scaling factor. With the help of the regularization terms consisting of pairwise and three-body interactions, we apply the proposed formula [I. Setiawan et al., Phys. Rev. A 96, 052106 (2017)] to regular triangle and open linear chains for N=3 spin systems and to triangular pyramid, square, primary star graph, and open linear chains for N=4 spin systems. The geometry-induced symmetry greatly decreases the rank of the coefficient matrix of the linear algebraic equation for regularization terms. Choosing a transverse Ising Hamiltonian as a reference, we find, for N=3 spin clusters, that the driving interaction consists of only the geometry-dependent pairwise interactions and there is no need for the three-body interaction and, for N=4 spin clusters, that the geometry-dependent pairwise interactions again constitute a major part of the driving interaction, whereas the universal three-body interaction free from the geometry is necessary but plays a subsidiary role. Our scheme predicts the practical driving interaction in accelerating the adiabatic quantum dynamics of structured regular spin clusters.},

To illustrate the main results, we consider numerical simulations showing the dynamics of errors made by the discrete nonlinear equation.

This quintessential solution is originally derived from the condition of additivity and linearity for the energy-momentum tensor. We carry out the thermodynamic properties of this solution using the Kerr/{CFT} correspondence for several specific quintessential equation-of-state parameters. A problem arises when we compute the central charge because the canonical conserved charge is needed to be calculated from the Lagrangian. However, the exact Lagrangian of the quintessence is not defined yet in the original derivation. Yet we solve this problem by the assumption that there is only a contribution from gravitational field to the central charge. Then we could find the entropy of this black hole after calculating the temperature and using Cardy entropy formula. Another problem comes out when the spin goes to zero to find the Reissner-Nordström-{NUT}-Quintessence solution. To solve it, we extend to the 5-dimensional solution. In the end, we obtain the entropy for this 5-dimensional solution. So the quintessential black hole solution is dual with the {CFT}.},

There have been a conjecture that there is a duality between near-horizon geometry of extremal Kerr black hole and the conformal field theory ({CFT}) on its boundary of the horizon, called by Kerr/{CFT} correspondence. Here, we review this correspondence where in the background geometry, boundary conditions are found for which the algebra of surface charges enhances the U(1) to one copy of the Virasoro algebra with central charge c L = 12J. After finding the conformal temperature, which is T L = 1/2π, the entropy is obtained from the Cardy formula. Finally, entropy from the Cardy formula agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr black hole and also with the corrected one. Kerr/{CFT} correspondence is also used to find the entropy for another black hole that we show at the end.},

	abstract = {The oxygen reduction reaction ({ORR}) mechanism on the active sites of a phosphorus-doped pyrolyzed Fe/N/C catalyst is examined by using density functional theory based calculations. The introduction of the phosphorus dopant creates three initial possible active sites for the {ORR} i.e., {FeN}4, C–N and P-doped sites. In the presence of O2, the P-doped sites become passivated while the rest of the catalyst sites are still functional. The {ORR} profile for the associative mechanism (the O2 molecule is reduced from its molecular form) on the {FeN}4 site is practically unaffected by the presence of the neighboring {PO} site. However, the {ORR} profile for the dissociative mechanism (the O2 molecule is reduced from its dissociated form) on the {FeN}4 site is significantly improved as compared to that on the undoped Fe/N/C catalyst system. This phenomenon is mainly induced by the distortion of C–C networks due to the presence of the neighboring {FeN}4 and {PO} sites, which leads to the stabilization of the *{OH} adsorption state on the C atoms next to the {FeN}4 site.},

Because of that reason there must be new theory based from Standard Model that can describe these phenomena, one of the theory is composite Higgs model where Higgs was a composite from Goldstone boson from symmetry breaking.

Besides of being hermitian, we also prove that both volume operators are real, symmetric, and positive semi-definite, with respect to the inner product defined on the Hilbert space of a fixed graph. Other special properties follow from this fact, such as the possibility to obtain real orthonormal eigenvectors. Moreover, the matrix representations of the volume operators on a vertex could have degeneracy, such that the real positive eigenvalues always come in pairs for even dimension, with an additional zero if the dimension is odd. This is general for the Ashtekar–Lewandowski volume operator, but special for the Rovelli–Smolin case. As a consequence, one has a freedom in choosing the orthonormal eigenvectors for each 2-dimensional eigensubspaces. Furthermore, we provide a formal procedure to obtain the spectrum and matrix representation of the volume operators. In order to compare our procedure with the earlier ones existing in the literature, we give explicit computational examples for the case of monochromatic quantum tetrahedron, where the eigenvalues agree with the standard earlier procedure, but differs on the eigenvectors.},

These operators are area and volume operator. The regularization process of these operators came from the classical definition of area and volume, thus, the eigenvalues of area operator and volume operator are respectively the area and volume of the space. However, there exists two types of volume operator, the Ashtekar-Lewandowski operator and the Rovelli-Smolin operator. The significant difference between these two operators is the fact that Ashtekar-Lewandowski operator is sensitive to the direction of the spin networks link, while Rovelli-Smolin operator is not. This difference will produce different spectral. In this article, we compare the resulting spectral of the two volume operators, where both of them is used to calculate the volume of the monochromatic 4-valent and 6-valent spin network for the kinematical case.},

	url = {http://www.aaqr.org},
	abstract = {The negative impact of {PM}2.5 exposure has encouraged the development of scattering-based {PM} sensors for monitoring the {PM} level spatially and temporally. These {PM} sensors excel in terms of cost, operating power, and compactness, but the performance of each model needs to be evaluated individually. The evaluation of a {PM} sensor can be conducted inside an aerosol chamber by measuring the {PM} concentration in time series using both the sensor and reference monitors. However, earlier experimental processes were time-consuming, as a long time was needed to decrease the {PM} concentration by loss mechanisms. We designed an aerosol chamber by introducing an output airflow rate to decay the {PM} concentration more quickly. The characterization of the chamber yielded an empirical equation to describe the {PM} concentration decay profile, which can be used to predict the measurement time and the number of data points. The chamber was then utilized to evaluate three {PM} sensors (Sharp {GP}2Y1010AU0F, Winsen {ZH}03A, and Novafitness {SDS}011). A condensation particle counter ({TSI}, 3025A) and particle sensor (Honeywell, {HPMA}115S0-{XXX}) were employed as reference monitors. The evaluation determined the linearity, calibration curve, and precision of the {PM} sensors. The evaluated models showed excellent linearity, with R2 values above 0.956. The least square and {RMA} correlation of the evaluated {PM} sensors demonstrated the best linearity achieved at a low {PM} measurement range (0–400 µg m–3). As the Winsen {ZH}03A and Novafitness {SDS}011 sensors had coefficients of variation below 10\%, both of the sensors have an acceptable precision according to the {EPA} standard.},

	abstract = {The process of thinking of students in understanding concepts and solving problems about geometry influenced by the cognitive ability of the level of geometry thinking of students, whether male or female. Van Hiele explained that there are five levels of thinking geometry. This study was conducted to determine the cognitive abilities of junior high school students based on Van Hiele’s geometry thinking level viewed from a gender perspective. The method used is a descriptive qualitative method with question instruments and interview guidelines. The research subjects were six female students and six male students. The results of tests and interviews were analysed to determine the level of the tendency of students’ geometric thinking. Research results show that there are four male students at level 3 (Deduction) and two students at level 2 (Informal Deduction).Whereas for female students there were three students at level 3 (deduction), two students at level 2 (simple deduction) and one student at level 1 (analysis). Male students are better at visual abilities and prefer simple ways of writing answers, while female students are better at verbal abilities and neater in writing answers. So it can be stated that male students tend to be superior to female students. This can be the basis for the treatment of students based on gender and cognitive abilities of students’ level of geometry thinking.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on the recycling of expanded polystyrene ({EPS}) waste to be repurposed as {EPS} nanofibrous mats for air filtration applications. The {EPS} nanofibrous mats were prepared via electrospinning technique. The {EPS} solutions for producing the mats were made by dissolving the {EPS} waste in dimethylformamide ({DMF}) and d-limonene solvents. The mixing ratio of {DMF} and d-limonene solvents were varied to obtain {EPS} solutions with different surface tension and viscosity. As a result, different fiber morphology (smooth fiber, wrinkled fiber, and beaded fiber) and diameter ranging from 314 nm to 3506 nm were obtained. The synthesized {EPS} nanofibrous mats were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, mechanical strength, porosity, and water contact angle measurement apparatus. The mechanical strength measurement exhibited that the beaded fiber had the highest tensile strength and the lowest elasticity compared to wrinkled and smooth fiber. The water contact angle measurement showed that the {EPS} nanofibrous mats were classified as ultra-hydrophobic, which was a good criterion for air filter media. Some filtration parameters of the {EPS} nanofibrous mats were measured, including particle collecting efficiency, pressured drop, and quality factor. The particle collecting efficiency of each {EPS} nanofibrous mats was measured using monodisperse polystyrene latex ({PSL}) particles and {PM}2.5 from burning incense as the test particles. The {EPS} nanofibrous mats had a high collecting efficiency (up to 99.99\%) and had a low pressure drop (below 70 Pa) for the face velocity of 5.4 cm s−1. The quality factor of the {EPS} nanofibrous mats reached 0.10 for {PSL} filtration and 0.16 for {PM}2.5 filtration. Overall, the {EPS} nanofibrous mats with controlled morphology were suitable to be used as air filtration media with high mechanical strength, ultra-hydrophobic surface, and high quality factor.},

Several types of new fundamental particles have been proposed as candidates for dark matter such as weakly interacting massive particles ({WIMPs}) but no definitive signal has been seen despite concerted efforts by many collaborations. One exception is the much-debated claim by the {DAMA} collaboration of a statistically significant annual modulation in the event rate of their experiment with a period and phase consistent with that expected from {WIMP} dark matter. Several groups have been working to develop experiments with the aim of reproducing {DAMA}'s results using the same target medium. Here we report results from the initial operation of the {COSINE}-100 experiment. {COSINE}-100 uses sodium iodide as the target medium-the same medium as {DAMA}-and is designed to carry out a model-independent test of {DAMA}'s claim. Initial data based on the first 59.5 days indicate that there is no excess of events over the expected background, confirming that {DAMA}'s annual modulation signal is in severe tension with results from other experiments under the assumption of dark matter having spin independent interactions and the Standard Halo Model. {COSINE}-100 is now taking data to study the presence of dark matter-induced annual modulation in the event rate of the sodium iodide detectors.},

	abstract = {Assuming a standard Maxwellian for the {WIMP} velocity distribution, we obtain the bounds from null {WIMP} search results of 59.5 days of {COSINE}-100 data on the {DAMA}/{LIBRA}-phase2 modulation effect within the context of the non-relativistic effective theory of {WIMP}-nucleus scattering. Here, we systematically assume that one of the effective operators allowed by Galilean invariance dominates in the effective Hamiltonian of a spin-1/2 dark matter ({DM}) particle. We find that, although {DAMA}/{LIBRA} and {COSINE}-100 use the same sodium-iodide target, the comparison of the two results still depends on the particle-physics model. This is mainly due to two reasons: i) the {WIMP} signal spectral shape; ii) the expected modulation fractions, when the upper bound on the time-averaged rate in {COSINE}-100 is converted into a constraint on the annual modulation component in {DAMA}/{LIBRA} . We find that the latter effect is the dominant one. For several effective operators the expected modulation fractions are larger than in the standard spin-independent or spin-dependent interaction cases. As a consequence, compatibility between the modulation effect observed in {DAMA}/{LIBRA} and the null result from {COSINE}-100 is still possible for several non-relativistic operators. At low {WIMP} masses such relatively high values of the modulation fractions arise because {COSINE}-100 is mainly sensitive to {WIMP}-sodium scattering events, due to the higher threshold compared to {DAMA}/{LIBRA} . A next {COSINE} analysis is expected to have a full sensitivity for the 5 σ region of {DAMA}/{LIBRA}.},

The cost-production of the {SPR} instruments is much more economical, namely around {IDR} 10,000,000 where the price of commercial {SPR} instruments such as {nanoSPR}6 is \$ 9,950. The main components of the instrument are consist of an Arduino Uno microcontroller, red laser, polarizer, stepper motor, prism, gold chip, and a cell phone camera. The light detection system of the instruments is using image processing that utilizes recorded data from the cell phone camera programmed with python software. The sample in this research used is pasteurized milk. The measurement results obtained from the {SPR} instruments are compared with {nanoSPR}6. The sensorgram result from the monitoring of pasteurized milk using both {SPR} instruments for 12 hours and {nanoSPR}6 for 4 hours has experienced a decrease in light intensity. The light intensity had decreased up to 8 hours from the time of observation and remained flat for the next 4 hours. This decreased intensity states that there is a shift in the angle dip during the monitoring process. This explanation is supported by track mode measurement data by {nanoSPR}6 that run for 2 hours, showing a change in the angle dip from 67.34° to 67.6°. The increase in angle dip during the monitoring process is because of increasement in the dielectric constant and the density of the milk during the process of quality degradation. In addition, it is also suspected to be due to the appearance of fatty deposits in milk which results in an increase in the milk refractive index. The change of the milk refractive index within 2 hours is 0.0023 obtained by a fitting process using the Winspall software.},

	abstract = {The extensive use of air filters has encouraged advances in both the fabrication and characterization of air filter technology. An affordable and accessible means of assessing the quality of air filters is greatly needed because of the high demand for these filters. We developed a personal air filter test ({PAFT}) system for measuring filter pressure drop, efficiency, and quality of filtration. The {PAFT} system utilizes a {PM} sensor (Sharp, {GP}2Y1010AU0F) to measure filtration efficiency. {PM} sensor performance was evaluated and optimized to guarantee its suitability for this application. The sensor performance evaluation studied the output responses to sampling flow, particle diameter, and {PM} sources. We also improved the sensor’s sensitivity. The experimental results show that the sensor had no significant influence on the sampling flow. The sensor output was highly dependent on the particle size and {PM} source, but its response curves remained linear, which was an advantage for filter efficiency measurement. We measured the efficiency of nanofiber filters of various efficiencies, comparing the results to a reference efficiency as measured by a {CPC} ({TSI}, 3772). The test resulted in a filtration coefficient (Kf), which was used to correct the {PAFT} efficiency measurement results. We also conducted filtration efficiency tests on commercial mask filters and the results showed good agreement to the reference, with a small average error of about 2.5\%. The complete design of the {PAFT} and experimental methods is discussed in detail.Copyright © 2020 American Association for Aerosol Research},

This precursor was prepared by the sol-gel method for creating the inorganic cross-links. The photopolymerization process then made the organic cross-links and transformed it into the solid phase. The taper structure formation was strongly dependent on the laser power and time duration. A typical condition for taper structure formation was the laser power of 2 μW and the fiber drawing speed in the range of 20 μm/s - 40 μm/s.The resulted tapers lengths were around 1.5 mm−5.5 mm with the diameter around 100 μm at the beginning of the taper and less than 5 μm at the end of the taper.

The subjects’ ages are between 30 and 63 for females and 36 and 68 for males and they had the same educational background, occupation and institution. Their signatures were collected from the same types of documents stored in several libraries. Combination of three characterizations enable in estimating the year when a document was signed. Ten signatures that have been randomly selected from two subjects showed that the bias in prediction of signing year was less than 3 years. The method is potential for countering the crime associated with falsification of documents created in the past by the same person, as a complement to the already standard methods.},

	abstract = {Single-atom catalysis, which utilizes single atoms as active sites, is one of the most promising ways to enhance the catalytic activity and to reduce the amount of precious metals used. Platinum atoms deposited on graphene are reported to show enhanced catalytic activity for some chemical reactions, e.g. methanol oxidation in direct methanol fuel cells. However, the precise atomic structure, the key to understand the origin of the improved catalytic activity, is yet to be clarified. Here, we present a computational study to investigate the structure of platinum adsorbed on graphene with special emphasis on the edges of graphene nanoribbons. By means of density functional theory based thermodynamics, we find that single platinum atoms preferentially adsorb on the substitutional carbon sites at the hydrogen terminated graphene edge. The structures are further corroborated by the core level shift calculations. Large positive core level shifts indicate the strong interaction between single Pt atoms and graphene. The atomistic insight obtained in this study will be a basis for further investigation of the activity of single-atom catalysts based on platinum and graphene related materials.},

	abstract = {The antibacterial activity of garlic (Allium sativum) is believed to be due to its organosulfur compounds, which can supposedly be used further in biomedical applications. This paper reported the use of electrospinning to encapsulate a garlic extract and glycerine in nanofibrous mats. Polyvinylpyrrolidone ({PVP}) and cellulose acetate ({CA}) were the building blocks of the composite fibres that served as the hydrophilic matrix to encapsulate the garlic extract with glycerine added mainly to improve the mechanical characteristics of the composite fibres. The combinations of the fibres were {PVP}/{CA}, {PVP}/{CA}/garlic, {PVP}/{CA}/glycerine, and {PVP}/{CA}/glycerine/garlic. The characterizations included the morphology, chemical interaction, swelling degree, weight loss, acidity level, wettability, in vitro antibacterial test, and release behaviour test. The composite nanofibrous mats were uniform, bead-free with a size ranging from 350 nm to 900 nm. The Fourier-transform infrared spectra proved the presence of the garlic extract and glycerine in the fibres. The swelling degree test showed that the fibrous mats generally did have maximum swelling degrees above 100\% except for the {PVP}/{CA} fibrous mat, whose maximum value was not achieved within 48 hours. The fibrous mat with glycerine showed generally larger weight loss compared to the fibrous mats without glycerine. The result of the contact angle measurement proved that the composite fibres are all hydrophilic with the {PVP}/{CA}/glycerine/garlic fibres being the least hydrophilic. The {pH} level of the fibre mats was from 3.7 to 4.0 due to the use of acetic acid. The Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the mats were significantly reduced due to the presence of glycerine. The encapsulation of the garlic extract in the fibres did not eliminate the antibacterial activity of the garlic extract, as proven in the in vitro antibacterial test. The release of the garlic extract from the composite {PVP}/{CA}/glycerine/garlic fibres was found to be the largest due to the large diameter of the fibres, while the blend of {PVP} with {CA} successfully reduced the rate of release due to the insolubility of {CA}. We successfully encapsulated the garlic extract and glycerine in the {PVP}/{CA} nanofibrous mats with antibacterial activity.},

The spectroscopic analysis have been carried out using Judd-Ofelt parameters and oscillator strength to determine radiative properties such as radiative transition probability ({AR}), branching ratio (βr), lifetime (τ), emission cross-section (σe) and quantum efficiency (η). The highest emission intensity was found at 1060 nm for transition 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 under excitation wavelength of 582 nm for {PANCaFN}2. The emission cross section, branching ratio and lifetime were evaluated and showed 4.92 × 10−20 cm2, 0.7 and 200 μs, respectively. More importantly, the outstanding quantum efficiency of {PANCaFN}2 could reach to 98.92\%. The addition of Nd3+ ion into fluorophosphate glass could enhance the spectroscopic properties which could play as a potential candidate for solid state applications.

The {ABS} precursor solutions were made by dissolving the {ABS} waste in three different solvents, {DMAc}, {DMF}, and {THF}, with various concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 wt\%. The solvent and solution concentrations affected the fiber properties (size and morphology) and membrane properties (wettability, crystallinity, and mechanical). Accordingly, we tested the fabricated membranes using {SEM}, {FTIR}, {XRD}, water contact angle, and tensile strength test measurements. The {SEM} images depicted three different morphologies, i.e. beads, beaded fibers, and pure fibers. The {FTIR} spectra showed that the solvents completely evaporated during the electrospinning process. The water contact angle test exhibited the hydrophobic properties of all the membrane samples. The {XRD} spectra showed the amorphous structures of all the membranes. The tensile strength test showed that the membranes fabricated using {DMF} and {DMAc} solvents had the best mechanical properties. Considering the fiber size, wettability, and mechanical properties, the membranes fabricated using {DMAc} and {DMF} solvents had the best criteria as air filter media. Filtration tests on the membranes fabricated using {DMAc} and {DMF} solvents with various solution concentrations depicted that the beads affected the membrane pressure drop and efficiency. The beads gave more space among the fibers, which facilitated the air flow through the membrane. The beads greatly reduced the pressure drop without an overly reduced membrane filtration efficiency. This led to a high-quality factor of the membranes that demonstrated their applicability as potential air filter media.},

	abstract = {We synthesized novel spherical submicron particles of turmeric extract ({TUR})-loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone ({PVP}) using the electrohydrodynamic atomization technique. The {SEM} images show the formation of spherical submicron particles for the mass ratio of {TUR} and {PVP} ≥ 2/5. Their average particle diameter increases with the {TUR} mass increment, which is induced by the conductivity, viscosity, and surface tension decrements of precursor solutions. Furthermore, the flow rate (Q) and conductivity (σ)-dependent average particle diameter (D) is in line with the particle diameter universal control given by log(D) = 0.320 log (Q/σ) − 1.135. From the {FTIR} spectra, the submicron particles clarify the intermolecular modes of {PVP} and {TUR} consisting of the vibration and the stretching modes at the high and low wavenumbers, respectively. Notably, the mass ratio of {PVP} and {TUR} modifies hydroxyl vibration modes. The {XRD} patterns show the dominant curcumin polycrystallines in the {TUR} particles, which are not observed in the {PVP}-{TUR} submicron particles. This result indicates the structural deformation of {TUR} between {PVP} bundles. From {DSC} measurements, the glass transition of {PVP}-{TUR} submicron particles (54.3 °C) is between that of {PVP} and {TUR}, agreeing the Gordon–Taylor formulation. Their melting point (166.4 °C) is lower than those of {PVP} and {TUR}, indicating the Schröder–van Laar relation. The relative mass changes of {PVP}-{TUR} submicron particles are higher than that of both {PVP} and {TUR}. Then, {IC}50 of the {PVP}-{TUR} submicron particles linearly decreases from (16.4 ± 3.9) to (10.5 ± 2.9) μg ml−1 with the {TUR} mass increment, implying the antioxidant activity enhancement with increasing the {TUR} mass.},

We used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof ({PBE}) functional, {PBE} with dispersion correction ({PBE}-D2), and van der Waals density functionals ({vdW}-{DFs}). We found that the adsorption energy of {HCOOH} by using the {PBE} functional is smaller than the experimental value, while the {PBE}-D2 and {vdW}-{DFs} give better agreement with experimental results. The activation energies of decomposition calculated by using {PBE}-D2 and {vdW}-{DFs} are lower compared with desorption energies, seemingly in contradiction with experimental findings at room temperature, in which no decomposition of {HCOOH} on Cu(111) is observed when the surface is exposed to the gas phase {HCOOH}. We performed the reaction rate analysis based on the first-principles calculations for desorption and decomposition processes to clarify this contradiction. We found that the desorption of monomeric {HCOOH} is faster than that of its decomposition rate at room temperature because of a much larger pre-exponential factor. Thus, no decomposition of monomeric {HCOOH} should take place at room temperature. Our analysis revealed the competition between desorption and decomposition processes of {HCOOH}.},

	abstract = {According to passive design principles, room air temperature is mainly influenced by the thermal mass composition of walls and floors. This article discusses the effectiveness of thermal mass adjustment using coconut oil (co\_oil) panels in a model brick house in Bandung, Indonesia. The effectiveness is determined from the improvement in air temperature profiles during the day and night under various weather conditions: clear sky, cloudy, and a combination of the two. Improvement is measured by (1) decreasing or increasing air temperature (°C h), (2) the average air temperature (T¯ °C), and (3) air temperature fluctuations (ΔT °C). All parameters were measured during two periods: (a) morning and afternoon and (b) 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (working hours) and 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. (resting hours). The air temperature was measured at 30, 120, and 200 cm above floor level to determine the spatial distribution effect of thermal mass. The results that were confirmed using the simulation program Energy2D indicate that the indoor temperatures were affected by the roof insulation, envelope, and internal thermal mass ({ITM}). Adjustment of {ITM} through the addition of co\_oil panels effectively improved indoor temperatures under all weather conditions, with more significant effects during clear sky weather conditions.},

	abstract = {The heat island phenomenon in major cities is partly due to the excessive use of concrete and brick, which causes many problems regarding thermal comfort and energy expenditure. The thermal behaviour of the envelope wall material depends on its density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity, and its effect on the heat island intensity ({HII}) is reported in this paper. Experiments and simulations were carried out on the four most popular building materials: brick, aerated concrete, wood with glass-wool insulation, and glass fibre-reinforced concrete with glass-wool insulation, with each material having a dimension of 1 m × 1 m. Experiments to analyse the thermal behaviour of the wall materials were performed by exposing each material to heat radiation from 2 × 1000 W halogen lamps for 4 h, followed by 4 h of cooling. The {HII} simulations were carried out in a simple urban kampong in a tropical area using Energy2D software. Heat flow analyses confirmed the thermal behaviour of the four walls, which can be categorised into two types: heat storage of block wall ({BW}) type and heat flow inhibition of insulated sandwich wall ({ISW}) type. The {BW} type showed 0.32 °C higher indoor air temperature than the {ISW} type, while the {HII} simulation showed {ISW} to be 0.74 °C higher than {BW}; however, both types increase the intensity and need mitigation treatment. The results of this study are important for the technological approach for dealing with local warming to lower the energy expenditure of poor people in an urban area.},

B6, 4370 (1972)] on the extinction spectra resulting from a transverse electric ({TE}) polarized wave incident upon a silver nanotube with a dielectric core. It is shown that the spectral changes separately induced by varied core radius (R in ) and the axial offset (d) are consistent with those reported for a gold spherical nanoshell calculated by the celebrated plasmon hybridization model, including the core offset induced symmetry breaking effect. This is followed by an analysis of the combined influences of R in and d on the extinction efficiency Q ext , which results in the optimal geometrical parameters of R in =31.5 nm, d=16 nm, and Ag minimum shell thickness Δ=2.5 nm for the maximum Q ext at the resonance wavelength of λ=756 nm. The different axial offsets are further shown to exhibit interesting variations of the angular distribution of the corresponding scattered wave intensity, which reveals significantly sensitive variations to different incident wave directions. The result has thus led to the following study for the exploration and demonstration of its potential development for sensing the direction of incoming {TE} polarized waves.},

	abstract = {Crystal structure and magnetic properties of Heusler-alloy Co2MnGa were examined systematically using non-stoichiometric compositions of Co and Mn element from the Czochralski as-grown single crystal samples. The crystalline structure of each sample was characterized by means of X-ray powder diffraction technique. Each sample was treated with and without heat treatment at 923 K for 10 hours. The effects of Co and Mn excess were observed in the lattice constants for both treatments. The L21-type crystal structure was observed only for the heat-treated samples. The changes in lattice constants are attributed to the substitution of atomic sites. The excess of Co tends to decrease the crystal volume, in opposite to the excess of Mn. In order to investigate the Slater-Pauling rule in the non-stoichiometric samples, the saturation magnetic moments were measured from the field-dependent magnetization measurement for the as-grown samples at 2 K. The deviation from the Slater-Pauling rule was found in the lower concentration of valence electron which associated to the lower total fraction of both Co and Mn. This indicates that the magnetic interactions of these materials cannot only be contributed to the number of valence electron.},

From the thin film resistance measurement using the four-probe method and conductivity calculation, the conductivity decreased as the {rGO} layer becomes thicker, namely from (0.58 to 0.42, 0.07 and 0.03) S/cm for A1, A2, A3, and A4 in consecutive order. From the photovoltaic measurement, we found that the utilization of {rGO} as a catalyst in {CE} increased the efficiency of the cell from 3.82\% (A5) to 4.52\% (A1). Furthermore, increasing the thickness of {rGO} layer from A1 (2.1 μm) to A2 (10.5 μm) also increased the efficiency from 4.52\% to 5.89\%, further increasing on the layer thickness A3 (21 μm) to A4 (31.5 μm) reduced the conversion efficiency to 2.57\% and 0.33\%. The highest conversion efficiency achieved for the cell with 10.5 μm thickness of {CE}, specifically A2. Further investigation of the influence of {CE} thickness and conductivity to the internal parameters of the {DSSC} must be done in order to gain a much better understanding of this result.},

	abstract = {Next generation high energy density lithium-ion batteries have aroused great interests worldwide. Herein, in a high-voltage (5 V-class) {LiNi}0.5Mn1.5O4/{MCMB} (graphitic mesocarbon microbeads) battery system using 1 m lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate/sulfolane, tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphite ({TMSP}) additive is added to significantly improve room/high temperature cycling performances. The unchanged X-ray diffraction patterns suggest the bulk crystal structure of cycled {MCMB} anode and {LiNi}0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode are well preserved. Moreover, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy ({XAS}) taken from bulk sensitive fluorescence-yield ({FY}) mode reveals the unchanged bulk electronic structure of cycled {LiNi}0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode. Therefore, it is concluded that only interface instability contributes to capacity fading of full-cells. However, electrode/electrolyte interface and corresponding interfacial reaction processes are always “enigmatic.” First, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS}) and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry ({DEMS}) are used to more accurately decipher the {TMSP} additive action mechanism in {MCMB}/electrolyte interfacial reaction processes, by identifying the interfacial solid and gas byproducts, respectively. Then, the crucial role of {TMSP} additive in modifying cathode/electrolyte interface is revealed by {XPS} and soft {XAS} taken from surface sensitive total electron yield ({TEY}) mode. This paper provides valuable perspectives for formulating novel electrolytes, and for more accurately depicting additive action mechanism in “enigmatic” electrode/electrolyte interfacial reaction processes.},

In this paper, a promising scheme by adding {GZIP} compression on the former {RSA} encryption method to increase speed is proposed; thus every transaction is going to require less times, therefore the number of failed transactions or requests will be reduced. Hence, this way makes the transaction easier for customers to do.

	abstract = {This research aims to qualitively observe the light absorbtion response from probiotic drink to several spectra of electromagnetic waves. This absorption response will later be related to physical properties of probiotic drink. The Observations in the infrared region used Bruker {ATR} Alpha {FTIR} Spectrometer while the observations in the {UV} and visible light region used Thermo Scientific Evolution 220 {UV}-Visible Spectrophotometer. The measuring time was done until there is a change in probiotic drink absorption. The measurement results obtained were in the form of the transmittance spectrum of the wavelength. Measurements in the infrared region showed some probiotic drink content such as protein at 6123 nm, lactose at ∼9532 nm, and glucose at wave number ∼1100-800 cm−1. In the {UV} region, it is related to the reduction amount of protein while visible light region was associated with changes in the constituent particles of probiotic drink along with changes in {pH}. All observations refer to the literature. The results of this observation certainly do not represent all the contents of probiotic drink but this method can also be utilized for freshness detection of other similar drinks that contain milk.},

This paper presents a fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cell ({DSSC}) with the incorporation of Cs2SnI6 perovskite in the active layer of N-719 dye. The absorbance spectra of N-719 dye on {TiO}2 mesoporous layer is found to increase by the addition of 2 wt\% and 3 wt\% of Cs2SnI6 in N719 dye in comparison to the reference of N-719 dye leading the role of Cs2SnI6 as photon absorber in the devices. Our fabricated {DSSC} device reveals a photocurrent enhancement from 6.36 {mA}/cm2 to 12.87 {mA}/cm2 by the addition of 3 wt\% of Cs2SnI6, along with the enhancement of power conversion efficiency from 1.71\% to 3.94\%.},

	abstract = {Two-photon Rabi oscillations hold potential for quantum computing and quantum information processing because during a Rabi cycle a pair of entangled photons may be created. We theoretically investigate the onset of this phenomenon in a heterodimer comprising a semiconductor quantum dot strongly coupled to a metal nanoparticle. Two-photon Rabi oscillations in this system occur due to a coherent two-photon process involving the ground-to-biexciton transition in the quantum dot. The presence of a metal nanoparticle near the quantum dot results in a self-action of the quantum dot via the metal nanoparticle because the polarization state of the latter depends on the quantum state of the former. The interparticle interaction gives rise to two principal effects: (i) enhancement of the external field amplitude and (ii) renormalization of the quantum dot's resonance frequencies and relaxation rates of the off-diagonal density matrix elements, both depending on the populations of the quantum dot's levels. Here, we focus on the first effect, which results in interesting features, in particular, an increased number of Rabi cycles per pulse compared to an isolated quantum dot and subsequent growth of the number of entangled photon pairs per pulse. We also discuss the destructive role of radiative decay of the excitonic states on two-photon Rabi oscillations for both an isolated quantum dot and a heterodimer.},

The infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies confirmed the formation of polymer cross-linking network and the protonation of the imidazoline ring. Therefore, in this {PIL}, the ionic liquid cations are attached to the main polymer network by covalent bonds, which make it so different from common composite polymer electrolytes. Such cations immobilization makes this {PIL} becomes more chemically stable and reduced phase separation. The fabricated {DSSCs} using this {PIL} exhibited a photovoltaic performance similar to that of the reference cells in this work, which used a standard ionic liquid electrolyte.

Architects and builders generally used heavy-weight building materials, such as concrete and bricks, for walls and floors to ensure thermal comfort of rooms; however, it is difficult to make a good composition of thermal masses that can result in thermally comfortable conditions. This paper discusses the potential of coconut oils (co\_oil) as an indoor thermal energy storage ({TES}) material for improving the thermal performance of rooms in addition to the existing thermal masses used in tropical houses in Bandung, Indonesia. Co\_oil is a very promising organic phase-change material ({PCM}) due to its high thermal capacity storage in sensible and latent phases. In this paper, the application of co\_oil for temperature regulation is considered in the light of two important aspects, such as the use of addition of a co\_oil mass and the effect of room air circulation. The role of {PCM} in the form of co\_oil as a {TES} material to regulate indoor air temperature is reported.},

The addition of a small amount of {ACN} results in the increase of ionic conductivity, and at a proper molal fraction, it may significantly improve the charge-discharge capacity of its half-cell battery. A large amount of {ACN} addition, however, reduces the specific capacity because {ACN} molecules are more susceptible to irreversible redox reactions at the battery electrodes. The experimental results are also compared with the X-ray diffraction ({XRD} pattern) of the solutions, which may lead to a suggestion in the formation of coordination complexes between the Li+ cations with {ACN} molecules, which effectively hinders the formation of strong Li+-{TFSI}− ionic bonding and therefore increases the Li+ cation mobility. Different from other reports, the role of this small quantity of {ACN} is considered not only as a co-solvent, but also as an additive to this {LiTFSI}/{BMIMTFSI} electrolyte.},

The measurement done was a biometric measurement by measuring stem height, leaves width and their numbers. The observations were done for 14 days starting from the first day of planting. From the measurement result, the pak choi can grow well on white {LED} light. While in other light sources, it cannot grow well due the lack in wavelength needed by the plant.

We used the nanoparticle dopant, namely graphite, {CuO}, and {ZnO}. Each kind of dopant was added to co\_oil in a certain amount of 1 wt\% and 2 wt\%. For comparison, the data of pure co\_oil was also taken and compared to the data from direct measurement. Because of the smaller diameter to height ratio, the lumped capacitance method is applicable here. Hence, the heat transfer between {PCM} and water during solidification or melting process is one dimensional, so that the one-dimensional transient heat diffusion equation for cylindrical geometry is applicable. Analysis of the data for solidification and melting processes led to the values of solid and liquid thermal conductivities. We note that in general 1 wt\% dopants have effectively increased the thermal conductivities of co\_oil, which is important for the effective heat transport of the material in response to the heat from the environment. More increase of dopant concentration has resulted in the reduction of thermal conductivities, which might be due to the agglomeration of particle dopant due to van der Waals interaction between particles.},

Doping {GeSe} with Na is reported to reduce its thermal conductivity due to the growth of Na-rich precipitates, but the electrical resistivity remains too high. In order to suppress both thermal conductivity and resistivity, a co-doping approach was used by introducing Na and Ag. Characterization using scanning electron microscopy indicates the presence of both Ag- and Na-rich precipitates within the {GeSe} matrix. The resistivity decreases by ∼6 times at high temperature with increasing Ag concentration. However, the thermal conductivity only decreases by ∼1.5 times after Ag doping of about 0.5\%.

	abstract = {The thermophysical parameters of organic phase change material ({PCM}) of coconut oil (co\_oil) with chemical dopant have been studied by analyzing the temperature vs time data during liquid-solid phase transition (solidification process) based on T-history method. The dopant consist of nanoparticles of graphite, {CuO}, and {ZnO}, each of them added separately to co\_oil in 1 wt\% and 2 wt\%. The data of pure co\_oil are taken as the comparison. Analysis of the data reveals the values of solid and liquid specific heats and the heat of fusion related to phase transition of co\_oil+dopant. In general, we found that the solid specific heat tends to decrease with dopant concentration, while liquid specific heat tends to increase with dopant concentration with a rather small variation for all type of dopant. The heat of fusion, on the other hand, decreases with the increase of dopant concentration. The temperature dependent enthalpy shows that the solid-liquid phase transition of co\_oil occurred with a temperature change, which might be due to its mixture composition.},

	abstract = {Organometal halide perovskites are very attractive as they can be used as efficient light sensitizing materials for solar cells with high power conversion efficiency. In this paper, we report the results of a study on various lead iodide perovskite crystals, which were prepared with different organic cations, and their properties in relation to their electronic structures, particularly their valence bands. For this purpose, we have carried out the {XRD} and {UV} Photoemission Spectroscopy ({UPS}) measurements along with the electronic structure computations. Among the organic cations studied here, it is found that not all organic cations can favorably form a perovskite crystal, though it meets the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. The organic cation, which shows the favourability of the formation of perovskite crystal structure, exhibits a band-edge shifting in the {UPS} spectrum of its perovskite crystal structure toward to smaller binding energy in comparison to the {UPS} spectrum of its organic salt. Such band-edge shifting is corresponding to the formation of the valence band in its perovskite crystal structure. The electronic structure calculations using Density Functional Theory ({DFT}) method, confirmed the formation of an energy gap that is in good agreement with the experimental results. However, the valence band is mainly constructed by the I− orbitals, while the conduction band is mainly constructed by the Pb2+ orbitals, as reported in some literatures. The present study results then suggests that the organic cations play only a minor role in their photovoltaic processes, though they substantially contribute to the valence band formation by transferring their valence electrons to the iodide elements.},

The model is physics-based and is given in an analytical closed form. We start by deriving a quadratic approximation of the quantum electrostatic potential with the two lowest energy levels using quantum perturbation theory. In addition, small-diameter cylindrical {SG} {MOSFETs} can be described excellently by taking both structural and electrical confinement effects into account. A self-consistent Schrödinger-Poisson simulation was used as a benchmark to assess the proposed model. It was found that the calculated gate tunneling currents determined using the model matched well with the corresponding currents derived using self-consistent calculations. The model is thus useful for fast analysis of gate tunneling currents within the context of a circuit simulator.},

The mechanical strengths have been evaluated using a Universal Testing Machine. Based on the tensile test results, the lowest Young’s modulus is 3 {MPa}, attributed to the brand labeled as F as the most elastic nata de coco among the six brands. The degree of elasticity of nata de coco also corresponds to the sugar content. Further, the optical properties have been observed using a {UV}/Vis Spectrometer. Clearer nata de coco yields higher transmittance value. Meanwhile, the turbidity commensurate the nitrogen content.},

The counter electrode was made of graphite powder which is manually deposited on transparent plastic using tube-shaped metal which its surface covered with tissue of 2 mm thick. Graphite powder was deposited by straight motion of 20 movements for one coating or one layer. The same activity was repeated on the stacked film to increase the conductivity of the film. Resistivity and transmittance measurement of the film was performed by four-point probe method and {UV}-Vis equipment respectively. The film thickness and 2-D porosity were measured using an electronic microscope and {ImageJ} software orderly. The film resistivity and transmittance gradually decreased with the increase of coating number and reached the resistivity of 0.35 Ω.cm and transmittance of 5\% for 40 times of coating. At the same time, the film thickness was saturated at the 30 times coating and reached the thickness of 9.4 μm. The film 2-D porosity which indicated how well the surface of the film covered the graphite also decreased to reach the film porosity of 18\%. The most conductive film (40 times coating) was used as a flexible counter electrode in {TiO}2/graphite solar cell. The efficiency of this structure was 0.4 \%, a reasonable efficiency achievement for a cheap material and easy method used.},

The experiment was done at 6 containers with similar volume and area and variable amount of catalyst, which is without catalyst (0 g) to 5 layer of catalyst (550 g).

Optical properties of {ZnO} were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry with the energy range from 1.2 to 6.5 {eV}. Spectroscopic ellipsometry data were modelled by Tauc-Lorentz and Gaussian oscillators to obtain the complex dielectric function. To extract the excitonic properties, the dielectric function was analysed by critical point line shapes. The results show that the excitonic states of {ZnO}/{SiO}2 are stronger and shifted to the lower energy, as compared to {ZnO}/Si. We find that electron transfer occurs from Si substrate to the {ZnO} films. The electron transfer then reduces the binding energy of exciton in {ZnO}/Si system owing to electronic blocking effect. Our results reveal that the different electronic environments affect the excitonic properties of {ZnO}, which is important for optoelectronic applications.},

It was observed that the thread conformation replicated the conformation of long polymer chains, motivating the authors to apply a 2D self-avoiding walk ({SAW}) model to explain their stable conformation. Strong evidence was identified that the thread conformation strongly resembles 2D {SAW} behavior and has scaling power comparable to that of a 2D {SAW}. Also, by fitting how thread end-to-end distance evolves with time, an equation was obtained that is exactly identical to the modified Avrami equation, which is usually used for explaining phase transformation processes in 1D space (D = 1). The exponential power of n = D + 1 = 2 was simply obtained in our fitting. In conclusion, it can strongly be stated that the evolution of thread conformation over time replicates the crystallization process in 1D space and an {SAW} in a 2D space, showing that these microscopic processes can be replicated at macroscopic scale.},

The fit bulk modulus and derivative pressure from the relation between lattice parameter and pressure are 89 {GPa} and 3.5, respectively. Besides, the calculated indirect bandgap is 0.645 {eV} (1.170 {eV} after correction) at room pressure and linearly decreased to 0.482 {eV} (1.007 {eV} after correction) at 11.3 {GPa}, when the space group is transformed to I41/amd. The calculated pressure coefficient (α = {dE} g /{dP}) of silicon system is -14.4 {meV}/{GPa} using the linear relation. On the other hand, the valence and conduction bandwidths are increased by the increase of pressure, mainly promoted by Si 3p states. Overall, the result shows that the reasonable pressure-dependence of structural and electronic properties of silicon can be obtained by using {PBE}-{GGA} method.

Reduced graphene oxide is used to improve the conductivity of both ionic and electronic conductivity due to poor sulfur conductivity (5 × 10−30 S cm−1). Graphene oxide ({GO}) was synthesized using modified Marcano and Hummer methods. Sulfur (S8) was prepared using the dissolution-crystallization method followed by microwave treatment to reduce the graphene oxide and sulfur impregnation into a graphene oxide reduction structure ({rGO}). Addition of {PVP} was varied at 0, 50, 67, and 75 wt\% of S/{rGO}, with variation of microwave time at 10, 20, and 30 min. The x-ray Diffraction ({XRD}) pattern showed that sulfur and {PVP} crystals had been formed. Morphological characterization using Scanning Electron Microscopy ({SEM}) showed a structure of thin layers of the {rGO} with small layers of {PVP}, while Transmission Electron Microscopy ({TEM}) showed black dots that are characteristic of sulfur particles. {TEM} showed that the sulfur particles had an average size of 12.8 nm. The C-S bond in the {FTIR} spectrum indicates that there was an S bond in the {rGO}. The {EIS} measurement showed a tendency of adding {PVP} mass, which increased the value of charge transfer resistance (R ct ). On the other hand, four-point probe measurements showed that the addition of {PVP} mass can also decrease the conductivity. Meanwhile, microwave radiation also affects R ct . The addition of microwave radiation time decreases the value of R ct and increases the conductivity of the sample.},

	abstract = {A sharp electrode model was employed to study tunneling phenomena in split-gate memory cell which has a sharp floating gate structure. This kind of structure are said to give significant tunnel current increase due to electric field enhancement. In this study we evaluate this claim by studying electron transmittance through potential barrier formed by a general triangular shaped electrode. It is shown that, sharp electrode give rise to a nonlinear potential barrier that are thinner than barrier from planar electrode. Using transfer matrix method, we show that electron transmittance from sharp electrode are higher than those of planar one, and has an ever increasing difference as the applied voltage increased. We also show that for a sharp-planar electrode pair, the most probable path of electron tunneling is the one that perpendicular to the tip-edge, due to the horizontal potential barrier has its lowest value at this direction.},

	abstract = {We report electronic and magnetic properties of the new half-metallic ferromagnetic co-doped system of rutile Ti1–x–{yVxNiyO}2 (x = y = 6.25\%). The semiconductor ferromagnetic doped system of rutile Ti1–{xVxO}2 (x = 6.25\%) system is revisited as the reference. The plane-wave {GGA} + U method was used after choosing U at Ti 3d site in the fully-optimized rutile {TiO}2. The co-doped system exhibits the total magnetic moment of 1.41 μB/Ni atom localized at the V and Ni sites which is significantly higher than that of the doped system. Interestingly, the local ferrimagnetism centered at the cations of V4+ and Ni3+ is found with the minor contribution from their nearest-neighboring O2− ions bound via the p-d hybridization. The Ni3+ ion induces the half-metallic behavior by introducing spin-up hole O 2p states above the Fermi energy level. Finally, the {GGA} + U provides accurate energy positions of sub-V 3d and Ni 3d states under the elongation Jahn-Teller distortion at the {VO}6 and {NiO}6 octahedra. Our result shows the significant effect of Ni3+ ion in modifying the electronic and magnetic properties of the rutile Ti1–{xVxO}2 system. This study presents the essentials properties which can be a guide for experiments.},

The morphological, chemical, and structural properties of both the {PEGylated} Gd2({CO}3)3 particles and Gd2O3 nanoparticles were examined using a scanning electron microscope ({SEM}), X-ray diffraction ({XRD}), Fourier transform infrared ({FTIR}), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ({EDS}) techniques. After the calcination process at a temperature of 800 °C, the amorphous, rhombus flakes of {PEGylated} Gd2({CO}3)3 were converted into crystalline nanospherical Gd2O3 particles with an average diameter of 80 nm. The hydrophilic polymer coating of {PEG} successfully attached to the Gd2({CO}3)3 particles which resulted in high dispersibility and stability in a water based solution. The magnetic properties were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer ({VSM}), which showed that the {PEGylated} Gd2({CO}3)3 and Gd2O3 exhibit paramagnetic character. Furthermore, in vitro magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) demonstrated that {PEGylated} Gd2({CO}3)3 particles show a promising T1 weighted effect and could potentially serve as a T1 {MRI} contrast agent.},

The method is ignoring heating and transfer process which is commonly used in the fabrication of transparent conducting film. Graphite powder is directly and manually deposited onto the transparent plastic by using tube-shaped metal which its round surface was covered with tissue of 2 mm thick. The deposition of graphite powder was performed by circle motion of 20 movements for one coating or one layer. Numerous layers of graphite film were coated on the previous stacked layer to increase {TCFs} conductivity. Resistivity and transmittance measurement of {TCF} was performed by four-point probe method and {UV}-Vis equipment respectively. It is confirmed that graphite {TCF} achieved the resistivity of 0.98 ohm.cm and transmittance of 60\% for one time of coating, while 40 times of coating resulted in the resistivity of 0.17 Ohm.cm and transmittance of 4.6\%.

By modifying the {PECVD} reactor through the application of Hot-Wire Cell ({HWC}) placed between two electrodes (called In Plasma, {IP}), and plasma generator frequency of 70 {MHz} which is categorized as Very High Frequency ({VHF}), graphene flakes have been successfully grown by using methane ({CH}4) gas as precursor at pressure 300 {mTorr} and substrate temperature of 275°C on corning glass substrate. This result indicates that this method is potentially to grow graphene at lower temperature by adjusting several growth parameters, especially temperature of hot wire cell that plays important role in the deposition process. It should be noted that important factor that greatly determined the successful of graphene flakes growth was the use of metal catalyst in the form of very thin film.

The generated sound is resonated by a rattle resonance tube to make it louder. The rattle tube is carved in a traditional way from a piece of bamboo with a certain length and diameter that are passed from generation to generation to produce the desired tone. In this investigation, we develop a mathematical model of sound generation by a rattle tube and formulate an equation for the frequency of the vibrated rattle tube from its physical and geometrical parameters. Since the rattle tube is not perfectly cylindrical, the frequency of the vibrated rattle tube is derived from the frequency equation for a perfectly cylindrical tube with a modification of the geometrical parameters to make them appropriate for the shape of the rattle tube. This equation can determine the tone frequency for given geometrical parameters of the tube and explain the relationship between the generated tone frequency and the resonant frequency. The model also shows that the discrepancy between the calculated and generated frequencies of the rattle tube is within the response of human ears.},

	abstract = {We study the electronic and optical properties of bulk {MoS}2 and {MoSO} systems using the plane-wave method within the generalized gradient approximation. The structural properties show that the O substitution at S sites tunes the z-axis Wyckoff positions of all atoms and the bond angles. The electronic band structures show that the substitution tunes the conduction band minimum at 0.8 Σ to M and significantly promotes more localized valence states compared to that of {MoS}2 system. The localization, mainly applying to Mo 4d and S 3p states, is more pronounced above −4 {eV}. Below −4 {eV}, O 2p states are dominant indicating that they are more stable than S 3p states. However, the substitution slightly increases the indirect and direct (K → K) bandgap of {MoS}2 system. From the optical properties, both systems show the strong optical dichroism. By means of the substitution, the σ1 width significantly enhances, while the plasmonic-state energy levels decrease. Our result emphasizes that the O substitution significantly tunes the electronic and optical properties of bulk {MoS}2 system.},

The generation of nitrogen plasma is optimized using optical emission spectroscopy, and the plasma is dominated by excited molecular nitrogen, which emits in the range 300–420 nm. The emission intensity of the plasma significantly depends on the flow rate of nitrogen gas and heater temperature and are optimally 70 {SCCM} and 650 °C, respectively. A further increase in these parameters results in a decrease in the intensity of the nitrogen plasma emission. An optimal flow rate and heater temperature are used to grow {InGaN} thin films on c-sapphire substrates. {InGaN} thin films grown with a {TMIn} vapor concentration (xv) of 0\%, 50\%, and 100\% at a growth temperature of 650 °C are highly oriented to the (0002) plane in a hexagonal structure. The film grown with a vapor concentration of 50\% has an indium concentration of 55\% and no indication of phase separation. Increasing the growth temperature above 650 °C results in a decrease in the growth rate.},

The nanofibers dressing which were prepared by the electrospinning technique using combination of synthetic and natural polymer excipients capable of fulfilling the ideal wound dressing criteria. This study aimed to develop nanofibers dressing prepared from polyvinyl alcohol ({PVA}), Arabic gum ({GA}) and honey by electrospinning method. This study focused on the effect of electrospinning parameters and the morphology of electrospun nanofibers of the blended solutions made from {PVA} (9\% w/v) – {GA} (1\% w/v) and honey (at varied concentrations of 0;1;3\% w/v) with or without Triton X-100 (0.05\% v/v). The effect of varied process parameters such as voltage and flow rate in electrospinning was also investigated. The blended solutions with the various concentration of honey at 0;1;3\% w/v and Triton X-100 were named as {FAt}, {FBt}, and {FCt}, respectively, while the blended solutions without Triton X-100, were named as {FA}, {FB}, and {FC}. The optimum electrospining parameter were 18 {KV} and 5 µl/minute for {FAt}, {FBt}, and {FCt}; and 20 {KV} and 10 µl/minute for {FA}, {FB}, and {FC}. Electrospun nanofibers of {FAt}, {FBt}, {FCt} showed smoother and more uniform fibers in comparison to the nanofibers {FA}, {FB}, and {FC}. The average nanofibers diameter of {FAt}, {FBt}, {FCt} were 244±45; 266±45; 283±57 nm, respectively, while the average nanofibers diameter of {FA}, {FB}, {FC} was 406±140, 457±168, 594±204 nm, respectively. Higher concentration of honey increased the diameters of nanofibers. The average nanofibers diameter of {FAt}, {FBt}, and {FCt} were within nanoscale in range of the {ECM} (50-500 nm), which were suitable for accelerating wound healing. Therefore, this study indicated that {PVA}-{GA}-honey nanofibers dressing is suitable to be further developed as carrier for growth factors.},

	abstract = {In this study, the physicochemical properties of {BCNO} phosphors were investigated based on the color of luminescence to study the luminescence mechanism. Multicolor {BCNOs} were synthesized by urea combustion methods using boron, carbon, and nitrogen sources consisting of boric acid, {PEG} 20k, and urea, respectively. The C/B ratio was varied from 0.3 to 2 with temperature variation between 700 and 800 °C, and synthesis time variation at 30 min, 45 min and 60 min. The synthesis process at 775 °C for 30 min with C/B 0.5 and at 750 °C for 45 min with C/B 1 produced samples with three different luminescent colors (violet-blue-yellow and blue-yellow-green respectively), where each color could be separated conventionally. The measurement of luminescence using a {PL} spectrometer showed photoluminescence at 413–485 nm for the 775 °C sample and 432–511 nm for the 750 °C sample. In the 775 °C sample, {PL} of sample red-shifted from violet to green, while the 750 °C sample red-shifted from blue to yellow. The result of the x-ray diffraction analysis ({XRD}) showed the h-{BN} phase shifting to a red wavelength from blue to yellow sample. The characterization of chemical functional groups using {FTIR} showed a wide B–N bond and increasingly sharp bonds of C=N, B–C, and B–N–B from yellow to blue sample. The morphology of the three different colors of the samples looked similar, with an irregular structure, but its {EDX} characterization showed an increasing B/N ratio for the green to blue sample. From these results, it can be concluded that the characteristics of {BCNO} are influenced by h-{BN} phase, where an increase of B/N leads to the photoluminescence shifting to blue.},

Garlic has been proven to exhibit many important pharmacological activities that bring benefits for human health such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antithrombotic, antihypertensive, cancer prevention, and lipid-lowering effects. However, the organosulfur compounds that contribute the previously mentioned activities have a high rate of degradability. In this paper, composite fibers of garlic extract encapsulated in polyvinylpyrrolidone ({PVP}) fibers are reported. The fibers were synthesized using the rotary forcespinning technique to protect organosulfur compounds from degradation and to maintain their antioxidant properties. The precursor solution was prepared by mixing 15\% {PVP} in 50\% ethanol (w/w) with garlic extract ({GAE}) in the ratio of 10:1, 10:3, and 10:5 (w/w). Microscopy images showed that the average diameter of fibers increases with increasing viscosity, which was the result of the higher polymer-to-extract ratio. All the fibers had smooth surfaces with no beads. The coefficient of variance ({CV}) of each fibers distribution was lower than 0.3, which marks the uniformity of the fibers formed. Analyses of the Fourier Transform Infrared ({FT}-{IR}) spectra proved some peak differences between the {PVP} fibers and the {PVP} fibers loaded with {GAE}, one of them is the peak at wavenumber 1034 cm-1 indicating the presence of sulfoxide functional groups.},

We also calculated the properties of monoclinic {ZrO}2 and {HfO}2 systems as the references. As a result, the systems show the significant optical dichroism between xy plane and z-axis indicated by the significant differences between the real-part optical conductivities along both directions. Additionally, the increase of dielectric constant is proportional with the absorption edge decrease for each axis, which verifies the Penn model. This work shows that the doping treatment significantly tunes the optical properties of Hf1−x Zr x O2 system. This report presents the essential properties for novel functional device applications.},

	abstract = {Since a nanofiber medium on itself is soft and fragile and cannot be used alone as air filters. Coating nanofiber on a rigid substrate to form a composite that can be handled readily is necessary. Beside can improve the filtration efficiency, adding the substrate will also save the use of nanofibers mat itself. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of substrate thickness on the performance of nanofibers mat in aerosol filtration in order to find the optimum thickness of substrate that can increase the quality of nanofiber filter. The substrate used was a low cost microfiber non-woven fabric made from polypropylene ({PP}). The nanofibers mat was composed of electrospun polyacrylonitrile ({PAN}) with concentration of 9 wt.\% which dissolved at N,N dimethylformamide ({DMF}). Five variations of {PP} different in thickness was used as substrate. From the {SEM} image, it was found that there is increasing fiber diameter of {PAN} after electrospun into {PP} substrate. From the porosity estimation of each nanofiber, it was found that the porosity decreased with increasing the substrate thickness. For test the performance of nanofiber filter, the particles of polystyrene latex ({PSL}) which generated by atomizer was used as the aerosol particle. In addition, to evaluate the performance filter in {PM}2.5 filtration, the experiment was carried out with generate the smoke from burning incense. Air filtration performance of all variations is obtained by comparison the results of measurement including: pressure drop, efficiency and quality factor. From the results, there is limitation on the substrates thickness based on the value of the quality factor obtained. Overall, {PP} nonwoven as the substrates gives the great contribution on the efficiency of {PAN} nanofiber.Keywords: substrate, polypropylene, thickness, nanofiber, air filtration.},

One of potential drug carrier for this purpose is chitosan based polyelectrolytes complexes ({PECs}) because micron-sized particles with good biocompatibility, non-toxic and antibacterial properties, that was inherited from chitosan, could be achieved. In this research, {PECs} were prepared by simple mixing method between chitosan solution and poly-2-acrylamido-2-methylprophane sulfonic acid ({PAMPS}) solution. The influence of chitosan concentration on obtained {PECs} were studied by varying chitosan concentration from 0.1 to 2.0\% w/v.

Considering that particle size of pulmonary drug carrier should be around 1-3 µm and preferable possesses positive net surface charge, {PECs} prepared from chitosan solution 0.5\% w/v might be potentially useful as drug carrier for pulmonary drug delivery system.},

Sn doping induces the decrease of grain size and promotes the formation of oxygen vacancy-related trap states as indicated by A1 {LO} mode in Raman spectra and green emission in photoluminescence spectra. Using a critical point analysis of the dielectric functions from spectroscopic ellipsometry data analysis, Sn doping blueshifts the excitonic absorption and decreases the exciton lifetime via screening the electron-hole Coulomb interaction. By varying the deposition temperature from room temperature up to 300 °C ({SZO}-3), there is no change in excitonic absorption. Then, annealing of {SZO}-3 at 600 °C under oxygen environment ({SZO}-6) strongly improves the excitonic absorption as well as its lifetime. Critical point analysis on {SZO}-6 sample clearly reveals the excitonic transition at 3.38 {eV} and exciton-phonon complexes at 3.66 {eV}.

The method consists of rewriting the system of equations for the equilibria in a constrained optimization problem at where the classical Lagrange Multiplier Method can be applied to derive the fold bifurcation point. By having one extra parameter as free parameter we construct two fold curves which intersect each other nontransversally in a cusp bifurcation point. This result is verified by looking at three section in two-dimensional parameter space by taking one of the parameter constant and study the stability of the equilibria.},

Here, we construct a dynamical model representing the interaction between Rhino and Bull (Bos Javanicus) with Allee effect for the Javan rhinos population. This Allee effect may occur in the field, among others, due to the solitary behaviour of Rhino within large territory, imbalance of age structure and gender and difficulty of finding mates in Javan rhinos population which causes inbreeding in the population. In this paper, we follow the previous paper on the territorial competition between Javan  rhino and Javan bull at Ujung Kulon National Park and add Allee effect factor on the Javan rhino’s population. We give a proof on the boundedness of the solution and explanation on the bifurcations that occur in the model. One of these bifurcations plays an important role in the system. Some simulations and suggestion on how to improve the survival of Javan rhino is also included.},

As {CS} is a new paradigm in signal processing, there are many aspects of this method that can be investigated. In the case of {DoA} estimation in noisy measurement, it is important to correctly determine a correct threshold of {CS} reconstruction, particularly when {CS} reconstruction is implemented using L1-norm minimization. Too small threshold value will make the correct {DoA} does not lies in {CS} reconstruction searching area, while too large threshold value will burden {CS} iteration to select a solution from a large number of possible solutions. In this paper, we derived an optimal threshold value for {CS} reconstruction for {DoA} estimation mathematically and verified the result using computer simulation. Using Gaussian noise model, we obtain the chi-square distribution of Euclidean distance of noisy and noiseless received vector. We introduce the thresholding index κ to scale the standard deviation of chi-square distribution to determine the {CS} reconstruction threshold and simulate this value for various {SNR}. We find that the optimal κ value 0.5 to 1 for high noise environment, and optimal κ value 1 to 2 in low noise environment.},

By making function based on synodic period of the Moon, Wada Date (Julian Date version of the Islamic calendar) can be made, and in the end, the Islamic calendar which based purely on the position of the Moon can be reconstructed. The purpose of this modelling is to create an Islamic calendar that has a higher accuracy than the Islamic calendar that we use today. The method that we chose here is the study of literature with the resources that come from articles, books, and internet. As for the analysis of its own data, we chose the numerical analysis method to approach the results of synodic period of the Moon data. From this analysis, we obtained a fact that the graph of synodic period of the Moon turned out to resemble a specific function. Based on the graph from original data, we selected two functions to approach this graph, and we named it the Fourier function and the Moon Phase function. Furthermore, these two functions will be compared to determine which of these functions will be selected. The function that has been selected will be used to make Wada Date which will be used to search for the length of each month in the Islamic calendar. If we have got the length of each month, the last process is to map out the dates for the month to a matrix that would produce an Islamic calendar.},

	abstract = {Vector control is regarded an efficient approach for preventing and reducing the spread of malaria. For several decades, insecticides have been used to suppress the population of Anopheles mosquitoes throughout the globe. It turns out that continual usage of a single compounded insecticide has massively contributed to the rise of resistant mosquitoes. Information on the evolution of insecticide resistance is considered an essential aspect in the control of Anopheles mosquitoes. In this study, a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of Anopheles mosquitoes is constructed, highlighting genetic classification based on their resistance status with respect to insecticides. Focusing on a one-locus case related to a specific insecticide class, the model is constructed according to a scenario in which the intermediate form of resistance called heterozygous resistance can be generated from random matings between susceptible and resistant mosquitoes, therefore carrying both genes. The model is governed by a three-dimensional system of differential equations that describes the interaction between homozygous wild, heterozygous, and resistant subpopulations, with three corresponding fitness levels related to their intrinsic growth rates. Criteria for the existence and stability of all existing equilibria are obtained. It is generally concluded from the model that the fitness levels heavily determine to which steady state the model solution converges. Numerical simulations indicate that long-term implementation of high doses of insecticide can increase the proportion of resistant mosquitoes significantly. Accordingly, understanding the fitness levels is very important for selecting proper intervention strategies as well as for predicting the long-term effects of the implementation of certain insecticides.},

All these characteristics have significant implication on the valuation of {ESOs}. In this paper, we improve Hull–White {ESO} model using Bino-Trinomial tree method.

Numerical experiments are given to verify the robustness of the proposed model and to analyze the sensitivity with respect to the model parameters.

	abstract = {During wet seasons, tropical rain may cause high discharge on rivers. To prevent flooding in the watershed area, sluice gates can be installed to control the water surface level. However, operating a sluice gate is not a trivial task; we must be aware of the backwater effect. Backwater is an increase of the upstream water level resulting from an obstruction of the flow, here is caused by the installation of a sluice gate. In addition, characteristic of the upstream and downstream flow which depend on flow types (subcritical or supercritical) must also be examined. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of steady river flow through a sluice gate. On a river flow, the presence of a sluice gate (with a fixed opening), will change the total energy of the flow. Then, using the specific energy curve we can determine water surface level behind the gate. Further, by implementing the standard step method, a steady water surface on the upstream part of the gate can be calculated. This surface forms a backwater flow that extends far enough behind the gate. Characteristic of this backwater flow depends crucially on the flow discharge and the opening of the sluice gate. For the case study, we took the Ciliwung River with the Manggarai sluice gate, located nearly in the middle of the river. With the aim of preventing flooding in the watershed area, we calculated several scenarios of sluice gate opening under various river discharge. Our results may help sluice gate operator in controlling the Manggarai sluice gate of the Ciliwung River.},

	abstract = {Wave run-up is the vertical extent of wave up rushed on a structure. To describe wave run-up characteristic, we tend to relate to its maximum height. It was a common belief that the leading wave will usually reach the maximum run-up. However, It turns out that this is not always the case. Resonance is a phenomenon when the incident wave shares the same frequency as the natural frequency. In this article, the natural frequency of a semi-enclosed basin on a plane structure is derived using the variable separation technique. Next, the staggered conservative scheme is used to test these natural frequencies through simulations of wave run up on a plane structure. The result shows that when the incoming wave frequency is close to the natural frequency, the largest run-up height is not the leading wave, but the second, third, or fourth waves. This indicates the occurrence of resonance phenomena. Sensitivity analysis was applied to show the dependence of the maximum run-up height to the structure’s slope, as well as the incident wave frequency. Further, a physical simulation was conducted to examine whether the resonance phenomenon appears in the actual events.},

	abstract = {Dengue incidence has been increasing dramatically in last few years with nearly four hundred million annual cases worldwide. It has been postulated that the wide-spread of dengue be due to climate change and increased exposure following the increasing human population in the affected regions. Climate change impacts on ecosystem have also set a critical role in the unpredictability of vector breeding behavior. A compelling strategy in the modeling of dengue outbreak must therefore integrate climate factors inasmuch as they determinedly govern incidence patterns. The aim of this paper is to construct a clustering integrated multiple regression model for predicting dengue incidence rate based on incidence, rainfall, and humidity data, which renders early warning information. The data used were dengue incidence data in Jakarta obtained from Jakarta Health Office and meteorological data from Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics ({BMKG}) in the period 2008–2016, defined on weekly basis. Cross-correlation was used to determine the interrelationship between dengue, rainfall, and relative humidity in Jakarta. Further improvement of the model was done by instrumenting the accumulated preceding one-month dengue incidence as an additional correction term in the model. The best fittings in terms of outbreak catchment and minimal mean squared error were obtained from the model variants involving the accumulated original and logarithm of the incidence rates respectively. Both the historical incidence rate locale and centroids of the meteorological data related to the clustering as well as the accumulated incidence rate serve as the key determinant for the upcoming incidence rate. An optimal clustering was determined in a way that the mean squared error achieves its foremost minimum, which almost coincides with the division into tertiles. These clustering strategies can be utilized to provide a more accurate forecast of the ominous dengue incidence for a few weeks’ lead-time.},

Perusahaan Gas Negara (abbreviated as {PGN}), the Indonesian company in the natural gas transportation and distribution segment, in developing data reconciliation system for billing process. {PGN} serves its residential, commercial and industrial customers’ natural gas need through transmission pipelines. We focus our study on the billing process for industrial customers, where gas consumptions are measured by combining measurement results from turbine meter, temperature measurement device and pressure measurement device. Normally, customers’ bills can be obtained directly from volume metered by volume measurement device. But in every month there are a number of anomaly behaviour in customers’ gas consumption data or reports on meter failure, although statistically there are less than 1\% of meter failure or anomaly behaviour from all customers’ data. Due to the large number of on-site meters which located in very wide area in Sumatera and Java islands, sometimes defective meter problems are already resolved after several days since the problem was reported/indicated, and this can generate loss for {PGN}. In this paper, we perform analysis to answer: 1. how to determine the beginning of the period where a volume meter is fail, 2. how to estimate gas volume delivered to the customers during the meter failure. The first problem is solved by analysing historical volume, temperature, and pressure data of each customer. The analysis results, in line with Spitzglass (Energy) Equation, that gas flow is linear to the pressure drop between the pressure at distribution pipe and the pressure at the customer’s pipe. We derive a procedure for detecting anomaly in gas volume data based on this phenomenon, where we reconcile the volume data and the pressure data and categorize the reconciled data into normal type or anomaly type data. The period during the meter failure is then determined as the period where the data in this period are of anomaly type. As soon as the period during the meter failure is determined, we then need to estimate the gas volume delivered during this period. We apply some forecasting methods for time series data such as {AR}(p) and Holt Winters models, and we choose the estimation from the forecasting model with the smallest error. The solution of those problems will be used for calculating bills for those customers which experience meter defective in the billing month. We develop a graphical user interface based on the anomaly detection method and the forecasting method. This system has been implemented, tested, and used by Energy Management Division of {PGN}, and will be developed into an energy management system.},

Expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients are presented for each case.

	abstract = {A new numerical method is presented to study free surface waves in coastal areas. The method is based on the phase resolving variational Boussinesq model ({VBM}) which is solved on a computational staggered grid domain. In this model, the non-hydrostatic pressure term has been incorporated in order to correctly described short wave dynamics. In simulating run-up phenomena, a special treatment, so-called thin layer method, is needed for solving the elliptic equation of the Boussinesq model. As a result, the proposed scheme is capable of simulating various run-up phenomena with great accuracy. Several benchmark tests were conducted, i.e., run-up experiments by Synolakis (Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids 43(12), 1329–1354 1987) for non-breaking and breaking case, a run-up case proposed by Carrier and Greenspan (J. Fluid Mech. 4(1), 97–109 1958) and a dam-break with shock wave Aureli et al. (J. Hydraul. Res. 38(3), 197–206 2000). Moreover, the ability of the numerical scheme in simulating dispersion and nonlinearity effects were shown via simulation of the broad band waves propagation, i.e., focusing wave and irregular wave. The propagation of regular wave above a submerged trapezoidal bar was shown to confirm Beji-Batjes experiment (Coast. Eng. 19(1–2), 151–162 1993). Moreover, the numerical model is tested for simulating regular wave breaking on a plane beach of Ting and Kirby (Coast. Eng. 24(1–2), 51–80 1995), and for simulating random wave over a barred beach of Boer (1996).},

The current empirical approach, however, yields data that are still incomplete, not fully representative, and not entirely reliable. In this study, hygric properties are therefore determined directly from pore structure information by applying stationary unsaturated pore-scale physics to model moisture storage and transport. The pore space is captured by visualisation techniques and further extracted into a discrete network of variably shaped pore bodies interconnected by pore throats. In this network, corner and surface adsorption and capillary condensation are simulated to define the moisture storage. Air entrapment is furthermore considered to determine the capillary moisture content. The resulting spatial moisture distribution in the pore network allows moisture to flow, in wet elements in the liquid phase and in dry elements in the vapour phase. The adsorbed corner and surface films moreover enable additional liquid flow. These various simultaneous flows aggregately define the transport property. A comparison to measured data validates the presented hygric property model.},

There is no simple closed-form solution for arithmetic Asian option hence the development of efficient and accurate numerical methods has become critical. In this paper, a modified binomial method is presented for pricing a more common arithmetic Asian option, by averaging the asset between two time periods in the life span of the option. This option is called the 'partial-average' Asian option. Subsequently, the representative averages are used instead of the actual ones for pricing the option. The set of representative averages is constructed first by determining the maximum and the minimum averages, where other averages are calculated by dividing equally the distance between the maximum and the minimum averages. For Asian option with average strike, if the distance between two time periods is widened by shifting the second time period to the right then the price becomes lower. But if the distance is widened by shifting the first time period to the left then the price becomes higher. The algorithm is not only simple but also easy to implement.},

	abstract = {Bilinear systems is the simplest class of nonlinear systems that represent many real physical processes. As an example, chemotherapy and virotherapy in cancer cells are bilinear systems. Disturbances is a factor that can interfere the work process of the system, and it can make the output of the system to be not in accordance with the desired output. Thus a robust controller must be found to make the system produce the desired output. In designing the controller, it requires a solution to the state dependent algebraic Riccati equation ({SDARE}). However it is difficult to solve the {SDARE}. Successive method is one of the methods that can be used to solve this issue. The idea of this method is converting the bilinear systems into time-varying linear system. This method has the following steps : first, we need to obtain the robust control for the linear system by ignoring the multiplicative term of bilinear system. Second, convert the bilinear systems into the time-varying linear systems using the previous result, and then solve the {SDARE} by the new performance index and the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. Last, iterate the steps until the convergence of state satisfied. In this research, successive method were applied in virotherapy control problems. The virotherapy model has been widely developed, one of which is the cell cycle-specific model. This model is a bilinear systems. There are four groups in this model: quiescent cells (Q), cancer cells (S), virus (V), and infected cells (I). Virus are injected into the human body as the control input to control the amount of the cancer cells. In this case, virus can only infect the cancer cells, and the infected cells will die when the lysis process occurs. Virus, as a control, is given with the aim of minimizing the energy used in the system. In this model we consider the body’s immune response as an additive disturbances to the model. Simulation show that virotherapy can reduce the number of cancer cells in the body on day 50, so the number of cancer cells in the body is only 16.6\%. Based on the simulation, the next virototherapy can be done after the day 50.},

	abstract = {Human Immunodeficiency Virus ({HIV}) is a type of virus which attacks {CD}4+ T cells. Insufficient numbers of {CD}4+ T cells will affect the performance of immunity systems so that someone become more risky to have {AIDS} or other diseases. {HIV} phenomenon is modelled as nonlinear system with disturbance, but there is no exact method to solve problems that related with analyzing nonlinear systems with control treatment. Thus, the nonlinear system is approximated into a bilinear system by using Carleman Bilinearization method. A robust H ∞ controller is designed as a control input to accomodate the disturbances in the dynamic system. Generally, the treatment for {HIV} is merely to obstruct the replication process. Therefore, the robust control input is described as the chemotherapy of hypothetical drugs which aimed to clear off the {HIV} concentration in blood plasma. Robust H ∞ control is built with the coefficient matrix of the bilinear system. The simulation result is analyzed by comparing the effect of the robust control toward bilinear and nonlinear system. From numerical simulations, an individual will experience heavy symptomps if the hypothetical drugs chemotherapy is not given. This finding is strengthening the urgency of robust control as a chemotherapy with a waiting time. Based on the numerical simulation with robust H ∞ control input, bilinear system has trends that give similar interpretation with the trends of nonlinear system. Besides that, robust H ∞ control on bilinear system has demolishing speed of {HIV} concentration and infected {CD}4+ T cells concentration which approximately equal to the demolishing speed from nonlinear system. Therefore, we can conclude that the performance of H ∞ robust control on bilinear system is nearly same as the performance of nonlinear system.},

For fixed basin length the lowest resonant frequency increases as the profile goes from rectangular to parabolic to triangular. However, the rate of amplification increases from triangular, rectangular to parabolic. A computational scheme is proposed, using a finite volume method on a staggered grid, and is validated against the analytical solution prior to being used to investigate the effect of porosity and friction on wave resonance. The relative effectiveness of friction and porosity in controlling resonance is found to be dependent on basin geometry.},

We can obtain localised solutions by combining two different states of uniform solutions, which can develop a snaking structure in the bifurcation diagrams. We find that the complexity and width of the snaking diagrams depend on the number of ‘patch interfaces’ admitted by the lattice systems. We introduce an active-cell approximation to analyse the saddle-node bifurcation and stabilities of the corresponding solutions along the snaking curves. Numerical simulations show that the active-cell approximation gives good agreement for all of the lattice types when the coupling is weak. We also consider planar fronts that support our hypothesis on the relation between the complexity of a bifurcation diagram and the number of interface of its corresponding solutions.},

This method is applied on a staggered grid scheme for the two-dimensional shallow water equations. A benchmark simulation of wave run-up on a conical island was conducted for validation.

Individuals obtain lifelong immunity to the serotype they are infected with. This becomes the main underlying assumptions of most modeling work on dengue. However, data from West Java, Indonesia, showed that there is a possibility for individuals to be reinfected by the same strain, which may result in significantly different dengue transmission dynamics. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-strain dengue model taking into account the reinfection with the same dengue serotype. We examine the effects of reinfection with the same serotype, study symmetric epidemiological characteristics and investigate the effects of antibody-dependent enhancement on dengue transmission dynamics by using a mathematical model. We analyse the stability of the model and perform global sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential parameters. We found that the model has four equilibrium points: disease-free, two partially endemic and coexistence equilibria. We also presented two Basic Reproductive Ratio Ri associated with the first and the second strain of the viruses. The stability of the model is determined by the condition of basic reproductive ratio. We found that when the degree of immunity to the same strain, κ, is between zero and one, the existence of endemic equilibrium is determined by κℜi, where ℜi is the basic reproductive ratio. Furthermore, we found that reinfection with the same serotype contributes an increase in the number of primary and secondary dengue cases. The results suggest that it is likely that reinfection with the same serotype may be one of the underlying factors causing an increase in the number of secondary infection.},

To cover the lack of spatial sense in the method, one uses statistical modeling, reaction-diffusion in continuous medium, or multi-patch model to depict epidemic activities in several connected locations. Here, we show that an epidemic model that is set as an organized system on networks can yield Turing patterns and other interesting behaviors that are sensitive to the initial conditions. The formed patterns can be used to determine the epidemic arrival time, its first peak occurrence and the peak duration. These epidemic quantities are beneficial to identify contribution of a disease source node to the others. Using a real structure network, the system also exhibits a comparable disease spread pattern of Diarrhea in Jakarta.},

	abstract = {We study a problem faced by {PT}. Perusahaan Gas Negara (abbreviated as {PGN}), the Indonesian company in the natural gas transportation and distribution segment, in developing data reconciliation system for billing process. {PGN} serves its residential, commercial and industrial customers’ natural gas need through transmission pipelines. We focus our study on the billing process for industrial customers, where gas consumptions are measured by combining measurement results from turbine meter, temperature measurement device and pressure measurement device. Normally, customers’ bills can be obtained directly from volume metered by volume measurement device. But in every month there are a number of anomaly behaviour in customers’ gas consumption data or reports on meter failure, although statistically there are less than 1\% of meter failure or anomaly behaviour from all customers’ data. Due to the large number of on-site meters which located in very wide area in Sumatera and Java islands, sometimes defective meter problems are already resolved after several days since the problem was reported/indicated, and this can generate loss for {PGN}. In this paper, we perform analysis to answer: 1. how to determine the beginning of the period where a volume meter is fail, 2. how to estimate gas volume delivered to the customers during the meter failure. The first problem is solved by analysing historical volume, temperature, and pressure data of each customer. The analysis results, in line with Spitzglass (Energy) Equation, that gas flow is linear to the pressure drop between the pressure at distribution pipe and the pressure at the customer’s pipe. We derive a procedure for detecting anomaly in gas volume data based on this phenomenon, where we reconcile the volume data and the pressure data and categorize the reconciled data into normal type or anomaly type data. The period during the meter failure is then determined as the period where the data in this period are of anomaly type. As soon as the period during the meter failure is determined, we then need to estimate the gas volume delivered during this period. We apply some forecasting methods for time series data such as {AR}(p) and Holt Winters models, and we choose the estimation from the forecasting model with the smallest error. The solution of those problems will be used for calculating bills for those customers which experience meter defective in the billing month. We develop a graphical user interface based on the anomaly detection method and the forecasting method. This system has been implemented, tested, and used by Energy Management Division of {PGN}, and will be developed into an energy management system.},

	abstract = {Angklung is a traditional instrument originated from West Java, Indonesia. It is played by shaking it and each angklung can only produce one note. A set of angklungs are needed in order to produce a whole song. An angklung player can hold no more than seven angklungs because of the size of the instrument. A player also cannot hold two overlapping angklungs since shaking more than one angklung at the same time is nearly impossible. These restrictions create problems that can be modeled as mathematical problem. It is called the angklung distribution problem, which is the problem of distributing angklungs to each player based on a given song so that no player holds two or more overlapping angklungs with the least possible number of players. In this paper, we model this problem into a graph theoretical problem where we use the concept of graph coloring to solve this problem. We also develop a method to lower the number of players suggested from the graph coloring by viewing the song as an array of symbols.},

In Indonesia, the distribution of rock art sites has been relatively well studied and documented. Indeed, Uranium-series analysis of speleothem materials overlying negative hand stencils and naturalistic animal paintings from the limestone karsts of Maros in southern Sulawesi shows that the rock art in this region dates to at least 40,000 years ago, and is thus among the world's oldest. To our knowledge, the chemistry of the Sulawesi rock art, including that of the pigments used for making these images, and with particular regard to the topology and morphology of these materials, have not yet been systematically investigated. In this study, we report the results of our spectroscopic and microscopic analyses of two samples of pigment collected from rock art motifs at Leang Sumpang Bita 2 in Pangkep, South Sulawesi. The first and second samples possess dark red and purple colours, respectively. Analysis shows that both samples contain iron oxide, which may explain their reddish colours. Nevertheless, microstructural differences are evident, including crystal morphology and size, and, in our view, are responsible for the discrepancy in the observed pigment colours. Our findings suggest that the sampled dark red and purple pigments are from the same raw material source (ochre), but differ in colour because of mechanically-induced alteration, presumably the result of varying pigment-processing methods used by the prehistoric artists.},

The difference in microcellulose size causes a difference in contact angle of about 5° at microcellulose solution 2.5\%. This shows the application of microcellulose on the reservoir rock surface model causing the surface to be more water-wet.},

We found that the enthalpy of formation decreases more rapidly in region of 0 {\textless} x {\textless} 0.55 and slower in 0.55 {\textless} x {\textless} 1, which is indicating the presence of two different stability region against sodium concentration. The substitution of Mg2+ into Na+ sites decreases the enthalpy of formation of {NCO} compound and suggests Mg2+ substitution could increase the stability of {NCO} compound. The Mg2+ substitution also affect the lattice parameters. In the electronic structure, Mg2+ substitution is found to lower the position of unfilled Co-3d band for about 0.2 {eV} compared to the {NCO} compound. The computational results also indicate that the Mg2+ substitution will not affect Seebeck coefficient especially at high temperature.},

Herein, we propose a post-synthetic desilication treatment that is controllable with an aim to preserve the high crystallinity of {SSZ}-13 zeolite during the formation of mesopores. The extent of desilication in alkaline media is controlled by deliberately leaving the organics within {SSZ}-13 frameworks as they can effectively hinder the attack of hydroxyl ions on siloxane bonds. The resulting {SSZ}-13 exhibits substantial development of mesoporosity with preserved high crystallinity and microporosity that can then be used to relieve the mass transport issues and lead to an increased activity of {LDPE} pyrolysis.},

	abstract = {Starch-based hydrogels are biodegradable and biocompatible materials which have large surface area and are able to absorb a large amount of water. Hydrogels can be made of inclusion complexes between starch and hydrophobic guest molecules, such as starch-oleic acid complexes. The resulting hydrogels have advantages as the inclusion complexes can prevent the starch retrogradation in the hydrogel. For this purpose, inclusion complexes between starch and oleic acid were prepared by mixing cassava starch and oleic acid at 85 °C with varying complexation times(1 hour, 2 hours and 5 hours). Optimum result (product yield {\textasciitilde}67\%) was obtained by heating the reaction for 5 hours at 85 °C. In addition, the concentrations of oleic acid for complexation were varied at 10\%, 20\% and 50\% (v/w) (calculated based on the weight of starch). The results showed that the maximum amount of oleic acid which could be complexed with starch was around 10\% (v/w). The resulting products were characterized by Fourier Transform Infra Red ({FTIR}) spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction ({XRD}), Thermogravimetric Analysis ({TGA}) and Scanning Electron Microscopy ({SEM}). {FTIR} results of the complexes showed vibration peaks at around 3600-3000 cm-1 (-{OH}), 2900-2800 cm-1 (-{CH}2), 1300-1200 cm-1 (C-O-C glycosidic bonds) and 1100-1000 cm-1 (C-C and C­-O). The {XRD} results showed that the resulting complexes were crystalline and constructed of V6-amylose, which was evidenced by the appearance of peaks at 2θ of 13.06° and 20.38°. Some complexes also showed interesting diffractions at 2θ of 17.07° and 30.26°. {TGA} results showed that the complexes started to decompose at either around 277 °C or 285 °C compared to starch which started to decompose at around 303 °C. {SEM} studies showed that the resulting complexes formed spheres with concave centers close to the shape of doughnuts. The complexes offered great potential to be applied as hydrogel materials, such as round hydrogels with initial average diameters of around 2.6 mm and 8.3 mm.},

The most ordered pm-Si:H thin films are obtained under conditions from which not only clusters but also larger silicon agglomerates are formed in the plasma and contribute to the deposition.

However, there is still a lack of research about microplastic abundances in slum area. Ciwalengke River is located in Majalaya, Indonesia, which is dominated by slum and industrial areas that probably generate microplastics. This research was conducted to investigate the distribution of microplastic around the slum area for the first time. Surface water and sediment samples of the river were obtained at ten locations and grouped into six segments location based on different land use at the riverbank. Microplastic particles were identified using binocular microscope and categorized by shape and size. The average microplastic concentration were 5.85 ± 3.28 particles per liter of surface water and 3.03 ± 1.59 microplastic particles per 100 g of dry sediments. Microplastic concentration in the sediment samples were found to have significant differences in location segment (Kruskal Wallis test, p-value = 0.01165 {\textless} 0.05), but no significant differences were found in the water samples (Kruskal Wallis test; p-value = 0.654 {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, microplastic distribution was dominated by fiber particle. More fiber shape might be derived from the direct clothing of residents in the river and fabric washing process in the textile industries. This was also revealed by Raman spectroscopy test of several microplastic particles indicating that the type of microplastic were polyester and nylon.},

	abstract = {Fly-ash based geopolymers have been considered as a low-cost yet effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal cations, including Cu2+, from the aqueous environment. In the synthesis of geopolymers, the fly-ash needs to be alkali activated using several systems rich in either Na+ or K+. Herein, we investigate the effect of alkali activation on the structural alteration and its consequence on the adsorption capacity. Based on the series of detailed characterizations, the geopolymers formed in Na+–based alkali system is found to have more organized structure compared to that formed in K+–based alkali system. Moreover, the incorporation of additional silicate creates ancillary structure which positively contributes to the organization of the overall structure. All the samples, fly-ash and geopolymers, exhibits Cu2+ adsorption based on Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second order kinetic. The geopolymers with more organized structure display higher Cu2+ adsorption capacity, which reaches 40 mg g−1 higher in comparison to 7 mg g−1 for fly ash sample. The structural alteration induces the formation of open-framework structure with more accessible sites which can accommodate more Cu2+. Our study provides a fundamental understanding for the design and fabrication of geopolymers as an effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal cations.},
