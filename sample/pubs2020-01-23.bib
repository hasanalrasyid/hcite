	abstract = {Options are financial instruments that can be utilized to reduce risk in stock investment. Barrier options are one of the major types of options actively used in financial markets where its life period depends on the path of the underlying stock prices. The features of the barrier option can be used to modify other types of options. In this research, the barrier option will be implemented into power option, so it is called power barrier option. This option is an extension of the vanilla barrier options where the Call payoff being considered is defined as PC=max(STβ−Kβ,0), and the Put payoff being considered is defined as PP=max(Kβ−STβ,0). Here β {\textgreater} 0 and β ≠ 1, K is the strike price of the option, and ST is the price of the underlying stock at time maturity T. In this paper, we generate the prices of stock using binomial method which is adjusted to the power option. In the conclusion, the price of American power barrier option is more expensive than the price of European power barrier option.},

The mean diameter was in the range of 0.25−1.87 μm, with a standard deviation of 0.06−0.172. TEM images confirmed that nonagglomerated TiO2 nanoparticles were highly dispersed inside the polymer matrices. We found that the concentration ratio of TiO2 to polymer in the precursor led to changes in precursor properties, such as permittivity and electrical conductivity, and resulted in changes in the produced particle size.},

Subsequent calcination to produce ZrO2:Eu3+ nanofibers with diameters around 300 nm. The crystal structure and photoluminescence of the ZrO2:Eu3+ nanofibers were studied as a function of dopant concentration and heating temperature. At a dopant concentration of 5 mol \%, tetragonal phase crystals were observed. Photoluminescence spectra revealed several emission bands in the red region corresponding to the transition of 5D0→7FJ (J=1,2,3,4). Two most intense emission bands were observed at wavelengths of 606 and 591 nm due to the forced electric dipole (5D0→7F2) and magnetic dipole (5D0→7F1) transitions, respectively. This work demonstrates that one-dimensional photoluminescent materials can be generated by a two step electrospinning and calcination process.},

	abstract = {An efficient numerical scheme developed on the basis of Green’s function method is applied to the investigation of structural effects on the performance of planar grated waveguide at the first resonance wavelengths next to the band-edges. Restricting ourselves to the transverse-electric waves, this study is focused on the effects induced by variations of the grating cell number and the depths of its four outer grooves on both sides. The different patterns of groove depth gradation or apodization considered in this study are all characterized by decreasing depth toward the ends while retaining the longitudinal grating symmetry. The effects of the modifications are expressed in terms of changes in the modal transmittance, reflectance, and out-of-plane scattering loss as well as the group velocity and resonant field enhancement. The most favorable result characterized by 15\% transmittance enhancement and 85\% loss reduction is achieved for the case with the most gradual changes in the groove depth. It is further shown that, for the investigated range of parameters, both the group velocity and field enhancement can best be improved by increasing the length of the uniform grating, without introducing any modification.},

	abstract = {A solution showing the existence of both bright and dark spatial solitons by a simple modification of a previous approach is obtained for a model of reflection grating with modulated Kerr media without imposing specific restrictions on the physical parameters. The resulted relations of the system parameters and the pertinent physical quantities reveal an interesting algebraic structure and symmetry properties containing the previous results as special cases, with higher degrees of symmetry corresponding to more specific restrictions of the parameters. Detailed analysis of the associated parameter space exhibits clearly delineated regions for the different species of spatial solitons with wide ranging variations of characteristics as functions of the parameters. A practical working scheme is then formulated for tailoring the soliton characteristics according to a relatively simple rule. This is exemplified by a specific choice of soliton characteristics supported by a realistic set of system parameters in connection with the study of the dynamical process of soliton propagation in the system. A further study conducted on the dynamics of linear superpositions of two exact bright soliton pairs shows similar relative-phase dependent, attractive, and repulsive interactions as observed in a homogeneous medium while exhibiting visible envelope broadening due to the diffraction effect. The diffraction effect is shown to result in a wobbling phenomenon for the case of two bright solitons with asymmetric amplitudes. In the case of wide-stripe dark solitons, the propagation features a rapid split-off into several narrow stripes, and the number of new stripes depends proportionally on the width of the initial stripes as well as the ratio between its forward and backward amplitudes. Finally, an enhanced breathing phenomenon was demonstrated as a result of increased nonlinear modulation of the system.},

The field of passive nanostructures has reached the stage of dissemination into the private industries, while the second are still in the laboratory scale. The activities in the active nanostructures should be intensified in areas such as biosensors, which is a great importance to support the activities in the field of Agriculture, the field of Health‐ improvement as well as in environment protection. Finally we discuss the possibility sustaining the development of Nano ST by structuring the institutions, the research and the private sector to form an effective National Innovation System to establish a generic step from identification properties through to production process.

	abstract = {Highly transparent undoped ZnO thin films have been prepared on glass and indium tin oxide substrates with simple process by sol‐gel route and dip‐coating deposition. Gel precursor of ZnO was prepared from zinc acetat dehydrate solution in methanol with the addition of trietylamine as stabilizing agent. Thin layer of gel precursor was prepared by dip coating and then followed by calcination at 400° C for 5 minute in air atmosphere. The thickness of the resulted ZnO thin film produced by ten times coating is about 150 nm. The films shows high transmittance larger than 98\% in the visible region (400–800 nm). Absorption is observed in the UV region with absorption onset at about 390 nm indicating varying band gap between 3.18 eV until 3.23 eV depending on the number of coating layer. The AFM image shows that the films seems to be constructed from random stacking of nano‐sized ZnO particle in the order of 50 nm. Among the prepared samples, the lowest resistivity is about 1.8×107 Ωm observed in the five‐layer coating film. In order to fabricate solar cell structure, P3HT was deposited onto the ZnO thin film layer by spin casting technique and then followed by metal (Au) layer deposition by thermal evaporation. The formed solar cell has the inverted type solar cell with ITO/ZnO/P3HT/Au configuration. By the insertion ZnO layer, the photocurrent was improved by more than ten orders of magnitude in comparison to that of without ZnO layer. The measured photocurrent decreases at large number of coating layer which is supposed to be related with the current limitation by the effective carrier path length in ZnO layer.},

The estimators always yield impedance estimates which are better than the conventional least square (LS) estimation because the ‘real’ MT data almost never satisfy the statistical assumptions of Gaussian distribution and stationary upon which normal spectral analysis is based. This paper discuses the development and application of robust estimation procedures which can be classified as M‐estimators to MT data. Starting with the description of the estimators, special attention is addressed to the recent development of a bounded‐influence robust estimation, including utilization of the Hilbert Transform (HT) operation on causal MT impedance functions. The resulting robust performances are illustrated using synthetic as well as real MT data.},

Single phase samples have been prepared by solid state reaction process using precursors of Bi2O3, PbO, CaCO3, RE2O3, and Co3O4. The precursors were pulverized, calcinated, and sintered in air at various temperatures for several hours. Analysis of XRD data shows that Bi1.5Pb0.5Ca1.9RE0.1Co2O8 compound is a layered system consisting of an alternate stack of CoO2 layer and Bi2Sr2O4 block along the c-axis. The misfit structure along b-direction is revealed from the difference of the b-axis length belonging to two sublattices, namely hexagonal CdI2-type CoO2 layer and rock-salt (RS) NaCl-type Bi2Sr2O4 block, while they possess the common a- and c-axis lattice parameters and β angles. The overall crystal structure parameters (a, b, and c) increases with type of doping from La to Ho, namely by decreasing the ionic radii of rare-earth ion. We discuss this phenomenon in terms of the lanthanide contraction, an effect commonly found in the rare-earth compound, results from poor shielding of nuclear charge by 4f electrons. In addition, the values of b-lattice parameters in these rare-earth doped samples are almost the same with those belongs to undoped parent compound (Bi1.5Pb0.5Sr2Co2O8) and its related Y-doped (Bi1.5Pb0.5Ca1.9Y0.1Co2O8) samples, while the c-values reduced significantly in rare-earth doped samples, with opposite trend with those of variation of a-axis length. Morevover, the misfit degree in rare-earth doped compound is higher in compared to parent compound and Y-doped samples. We argue that these structural changes induced by rare-earth doping may provide information for the variation of electronic structure of Co-ions (Co3+ and Co4+), in particular their different spin states of low-spin, intermediate-spin, and high-spin. This, in turn, will affect the thermoelectric properties (Seebeck coefficient) of the system.},

A composite was made by mixing the nanoporous carbon with NaOH‐PEG activation, the exfoliated graphite and a binder of PVA solution, grinding the mixture, and annealing it using ultrasonic bath for 1 hour. All of as‐synthesized materials were characterized by employing a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a MATLAB’s image processing toolbox, and an x‐ray diffractometer (XRD). It was confirmed that the composite is crystalline with (002) and (004) orientations. In addition, it was also found that the composite has a high surface area, a high distribution of pore sizes less than 40 nm, and a high porosity (67\%). Noting that the pore sizes less than 20 nm are significant for ionic species storage and those in the range of 20 to 40 nm are very accessible for ionic clusters mobility across the pores, the composite is a promising material for the application as supercapacitor electrodes.},

On the other hand, those energetic events could generate shock wave of solar energetic particles (SEP) and propagate in the inter‐planetary medium to disturb the Earth environment. Geomagnetic storm is a severe geomagnetic disturbance due solar source phenomena. The manifestations of storms are strong deviations in the Earth’s magnetic field from the quiet conditions that extend over wide geographic areas: from high‐latitude to mid‐latitude and equatorial regions. Large geomagnetic storms can cause deleterious effects on space‐ and ground‐based installations. We study magnetic cloud in connection to shock wave of SEP and geomagnetic storms on the November 20, 2003 and December 14, 2006 events. Magnetic clouds have already modeled. We identified magnetic cloud from the variation of magnetic field obtain from MAG instrument onboard ACE satellite with one hour resolution data. The steep fluctuations as a shock wave were computed and divided into magnetic field, proton speed and proton density. We study for each of their arrival time. We confirm that southward Bz component is dominant during magnetic cloud event. We also observed fine structures of a shock wave. These results may predict better the impacts of space weather to the space instruments and lower Earth’s atmosphere.},

It means that the brightness of the moon is smaller than brightness of the sky. Based on the contrast value, it is impossible to observe the lunar crescent by the naked eye at that time, even equipped by special design telescope for the crescent observation at Bosscha Observatory. Sultan [11] proposed a predicted model it is still possible to observe the very young lunar crescent even under circumstance before the time of sunset, if the contrast of sky is perfect.

It consist also around magnetite (34.35\%–59.85\%), Pyrite (18.3\%–29.71\%, Quartz (15.31\%–25.43\%), Garnet (1.73\%–3\%), Rutile (0.46\%), Chalcopyrite (0.17\%–1.46\%), Pyroxene (0.8\%–2.35\%), Hematite (3.49\%) and Iron oxide (1.80\%–4.81\%). Geoelectric data show a conductive layer with resistivity type between 1.38 ohm m‐47.3 ohm m. If this layer is correlated with well data, the deposition of sediment contains of Fe between 5.3\%–8.2\% and Copper between 0.18\%–0.23\%. This method is based on rock physics which done by correlating many laboratory experiment, field measurements and well data. Prediction of Fe and Cu found on every line is good enough, this is indicated by the RMS error of less than 5\%, against the actual data in each of the wells. Therefore, it shown that we can image the distribution of Fe and Cu accurately using the method.},

In the vicinity of a cave, SP anomaly is dominantly generated by the resistivity contrast of the cave with its environment and the current source associated with the streaming potential generated by fluid flow through the cave. In this study we applied a simple qualitative analysis to understand the SP values caused by streaming potential and values that are due to the presence of caves. Further, we conducted two‐dimensional SP continuous modeling by solving the fluid velocity vector first in the modeling domain. Current source distribution and hence the SP value are obtained by incorporating resistivity value of the subsurface and calculating the divergence of the velocity vector. For validation, this scheme was applied in detection caves dug by Japanese army during WWII as at Djuanda Forest Park, Bandung. The results can be used to understand the characteristics of fluid flow and current source distribution around cavities that are responsible for the observed SP anomaly at the surface.},

The Augmented Dickey‐Fuller Test was employed on quarterly data for the period January 2000 to December 2008 to test for stationarity on the variables of interest. Estimates of the long‐term influence of exchange rate volatility on the trade flows are obtained using the Johansen Cointegration Test. The results suggest that a significant long‐term relationship linking exchange rate volatility and the trade volume between Indonesia and the United States exists. A negative long‐term relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and the export volume sent from Indonesia to the US is obtained. On the other hand, exchange rate volatility exerts a positive long‐term effect upon the import volume.},

The present study has the objective to estimate the effect of whole core configuration as well as burnup effects to the reactor core profile by adopting two dimensional model of fuel core management. About more than 40 months of cycle period has been employed for one cycle fuel irradiation of three batches fuel system for large water cooled thorium reactors. All position of fuel arrangement contributes to the total core conversion ratio which gives conversion ratio less than unity of at the BOC and it contributes to higher than unity (1.01) at the EOC after some irradiation process. Inner part and central part give the important part of breeding contribution with increasing burnup process, while criticality is reduced with increasing the irradiation time. Feasibility of breeding capability of water‐cooled thorium reactors for whole core fuel arrangement has confirmed from the obtained conversion ratio which shows higher than unity. Whole core analysis on evaluating reactivity change which is caused by the change of voided condition has been employed for conservative assumption that 100\% coolant and moderator are voided. It obtained always a negative void reactivity coefficient during reactor operation which shows relatively more negative void coefficient at BOC (fresh fuel composition), and it becomes less negative void coefficient with increasing the operation time. Negative value of void reactivity coefficient shows the reactor has good safety properties in relation to the reactivity profile which is the main parameter in term of criticality safety analysis. Therefore, this evaluation has confirmed that breeding condition and negative coefficient can be obtained simultaneously for water‐cooled thorium reactor obtains based on the whole core fuel arrangement.},

The patient blood and the dialyzing solution (dialysate) are flowed counter currently in a dialyzer to allow volume flux of fluid and diffusion of solutes from the blood to the dialysate through a semipermiable membrane. The volume flux of fluid depends on the hydrostatic and the osmotic pressure difference between the blood and the dialysate. It also depends on the membrane parameter that represents how the membrane allows the fluid and the solutes to move across as a result of the pressure difference, known as the ultrafiltration coefficient Kuf. The coefficient depends on the number and the radius of membrane pores for the movement of the fluids and the solutes across the membrane. The measured membrane ultrafiltration coefficient of reused dialyzer shows fluctuation between one uses to another without any significant trend of change. This indicates that the cleaning process carried out before reuse does not cause perfect removal of clots that happen in the previous use. Therefore the unblocked pores are forced to work hardly to obtain targeted volume flux in a certain time of treatment. This may increase the unblocked pore radius. Reuse is stopped when there is indication of blood leakage during the hemodialysis treatment.},

	abstract = {In geophysical testing, resistivity method is already widely employed. However, in developing countries the available resistivity equipment is mostly 1D resistivity system which employs four electrode configurations to measure the resistivity of soils. The multi channel resistivity system is simply too expensive for ordinary private geophysical company. Only governmental offices whose main job is to do geophysical research can afford to purchase multi channel resistivity system. In order to suppress the cost of the Multi Channel Resistivity System, this research develops multi channel resistivity system with programmable multiplexer switch and makes use of the already available 1D resistivity equipment as current injector. The new system consists of National Instruments PXI with programmable multiplexer switch cards, an Analog to Digital card to read the data, multi wires take‐out cables and thirty two electrodes.},

If one places a magnetic source on the vibrating object, so a magnetic sensor can measure its position by measuring the magnetic field strength from a reference position. There are two parameters that should be determined of a vibrating object, namely amplitude and frequency. Using Fourier Transform and a good mathematical model, these two parameters can be well determined. For this purpose, we have developed a vibration sensor based on fluxgate magnetic sensor. A mathematical model using 4th order polynomial approach has been developed for this sensor. Using this model, the developed sensor can measure vibration in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 g with relative errors below 3\%.},

One of them is oxygen. Oxygen is always found in the human blood. Its concentration in human blood gives information about the metabolism in the body. The purpose of this study was to look for a possibility for developing tool to detect the concentration of oxygen in blood. In this study, the giant‐magneto‐resistance (GMR) sensor is implemented. The GMR sensor has many attractive features, for example: reduced size, low‐power consumption, low price, as compared to other magnetic sensors and its electric and magnetic properties can be varied in very wide range. In this experiment, we developed the structure of GMR materials NiCoFe/Cu/NiCoFe sandwich as a GMR sensor. The NiCoFe/Cu/NiCoFe sandwiches were grown onto Si (111) substrates by the dc‐opposed target magnetron sputtering (dc‐OTMS) technique. The sputtering targets were NiCoFe and Cu. To achieve the aims of this study, the blood transports in human will be simulated using a simple experimental model. This model has some parameters representing those in blood transport. Furthermore, the nanomagnetic material will be made as a contaminant particle in blood. Using this material some properties of the transport will be investigated.},

For this reactor design, a suitable fuel‐loading scheme is the Peu à Peu (little by little) fueling scheme. In the Peu à Peu modus, there is no unloading device; as such, the fuels are never discharged and remain at the bottom of the core during reactor operation. This means that the burnup cycle and reactivity is controlled by the addition of fuel. The objectives of the the present study were to find a means of carrying out the exact calculations needed to analyze the Peu à Peu fuel‐loading scheme and to optimize the fuel composition, and fuel‐loading scheme to achieve better burnup characteristics. The Monte Carlo method is used to perform calculations with high accuracy. Before the calculation of the whole core, the analysis for the infinite geometry was performed. The power generated per mass consumed for each combination of the uranium enrichment and packing fraction was analyzed from the parametric survey. By using the optimal value obtained, a whole‐core calculation for the small 20 MWth reactor was performed and the criticality and burnup of this design was analyzed.},

They are based on the concept of a long‐life core reactor developed in Indonesia since early 1990 in collaboration with the Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors of the Tokyo Institute of Technology (RLNR TITech). The reactor cores are designed to have near zero (less then one effective delayed neutron fraction) burn‐up reactivity swing during the whole course of their operation to avoid a possibility of prompt criticality accident. The basic concept is that central region of the reactor core is filled with fertile (blanket) material. During the reactor operation fissile material accumulates in this central region, which helps to compensate fissile material loss in the peripheral core region and also contributes to negative coolant loss reactivity effect. A concept of high fuel volume fraction in the core is applied to achieve smaller size of a critical reactor. In this paper we consider to add Np‐237 to the fuel to enhance non proliferation characteristics of the systems. The effect of Np‐237 amount variation is discussed.},

	abstract = {Spent fuel from LWR can be seen as long‐live waste if it is not recycled or as a “new fuel” resource if it is recycled into the reactors. Uranium and plutonium have been used for “new fuel” resources from LWR spent fuel as MOX fuel type which is loaded into thermal reactor or fast reactor types. Other actinides from the spent fuel such as neptunium, americium and curium as minor actinide (MA) are considered to be loaded into the reactors for specific purposes, recently. Those purposes such as for increasing protected plutonium production and breeding capability for protected plutonium as well as in the same time those amount of MA can be reduced to a small quantity as a burner or transmutation purpose. Some investigations and scientific approaches are performed in order to increase a material “barrier” in plutonium isotope composition by increasing the even mass number of plutonium isotope such as Pu‐238, Pu‐240 and Pu‐242 as plutonium protected composition. Higher material barrier which related to intrinsic properties of plutonium isotopes with even mass number (Pu‐238, Pu‐240 and Pu‐242), are recognized because of their intense decay heat (DH) and high spontaneous fission neutron (SFN) rates. Those even number mass of plutonium isotope contribute to some criteria of plutonium characterization which will be adopted for present study such as IAEA, Pellaud and Kessler criteria (IAEA, 1972; Pellaud, 2002; and Kessler, 2007). The present paper intends to evaluate the breeding capability as a fuel sustainability index of the reactors and to analyze the composition of protected plutonium production of large power reactor based on the FaCT FBR as reference (Ohki, et al., 2008). Three dimensional FBR core configuration has been adopted which is based on the core optimization calculation of SRAC‐CITATION code as reactor core analysis and JENDL‐3.3 is adopted for nuclear data library. Some MA doping materials are loaded into the blanket regions which can be considered as breeding region for protected plutonium production. Breeding capability of the reactor can be increased effectively by increasing MA doping rate while criticality condition of the reactor is reduced by doping MA. Adopting MA cycle is also effective to increase the isotopic Pu‐238 production in plutonium vector composition for denaturing purpose of plutonium.},

Its common problem is to find an optimum arrangement of fuel assemblies inside the reactor core. Main objective for this activity is to reduce the cost of generating electricity, which can be done by altering several physical properties of the nuclear reactor without violating any of the constraints imposed by operational and safety considerations. This research try to address the problem of nuclear fuel arrangement problem, which is, leads to the multi‐objective optimization problem. However, the calculation of the reactor core physical properties itself is a heavy computation, which became obstacle in solving the optimization problem by using genetic algorithm optimization.
This research tends to address that problem by using the emerging General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) techniques implemented by C language for CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel programming. By using this parallel programming technique, we develop parallelized nuclear reactor fitness calculation, which is involving numerical finite difference computation.

The superiority of BNCT is that the radiation effects could be limited only for the tumor cells. BNCT radiation dose depends on the distribution of boron in the tumor. Absorbed dose to the cells from the reaction 10B (n, α) 7Li was calculated near interface medium containing boron and boron‐free region. The method considers the contribution of the alpha particle and recoiled lithium particle to the absorbed dose and the variation of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) charged particles energy. Geometrical factor data of boron distribution for the spherical surface is used to calculate the energy absorbed in the tumor cells, brain and scalp for case Glioblastoma Multiforme. The result shows that the optimal dose in tumor is obtained for boron concentrations of 22.1 mg 10B/g blood.},

The percentage depth dose of electron beams takes account not only on the value of electron’s energy, but also on the type of electron’s energy. The aims of this work are to carry on the effect of energy parameter of electron on the percentage depth dose of electron beam. Monte Carlo method is chosen in this project, due to the superior of this method for simulating the random process such as the transport particle in matter. The DOSXYZnrc usercode was used to simulate the electron transport in water phantom. Two aspects of electron’s energy parameter were investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. In the first aspect, electron energy’s value was varied also its spectrum. In the second aspect, the geometry of electron’s energy was taken account on. The parallel beam and the point source were chosen as the geometry of The measurements of percentage depth dose were conducted to compare with its simulation. The ionization chamber was used in these measurements. Presentation of the results of this work is given not only based on the shape of the percentage depth dose from the simulation and measurement, but also on the other aspect in its curve. The result of comparison between the simulation and its measurement shows that the shape of its curve depends on the energy value of electron and the type of its energy. The energy value of electron affected the depth maximum of dose.},

It will be demonstrated that the information obtained by SPECT/CT is more accurate in evaluating patients/objects than that obtained from either SPECT or CT alone. The registration methods developed here are for both two‐dimensional and three‐dimensional registration. We used normalized mutual information (NMI) which is amenable for images produced by different modalities and having unclear boundaries between tissues. The segmentation components used in this software is region growing algorithms which have proven to be an effective approach for image segmentation. The implementations of region growing developed here are connected threshold and neighborhood connected.

The weight of mercury in each cell of the plant is designed approximately 1700 kg. Radiotracer is prepared by mixing 203Hg radioactive mercury with 2400 g of inactive mercury in a bath. The respective precisely weighted mercury aliquots to be injected into the cells are prepared by pouring approximately 130 g of radioactive mercury taken from the bath into 13 standard vials, in accordance with the number of the cells tested. Four standard references prepared by further dilution of ±2 g active mercury taken from the bath to obtain the dilution factors range of 12,000 to 20,000 from which the calibration graph is constructed. The injection process is conducting by pouring the radioactive mercury from aliquots into the flowing mercury at the inlet side of the cell and allows them to mix thoroughly. It is assumed that the mass of the radiotracer injected into a closed system remains constant, at least during the period of the test. From this experiment it was observed that the mixing time is two days after injection of radioactive mercury. The inactive mercury in each electrolytic cell calculated by the radiotracer method is of the range 1351.529 kg to 1966.354 kg with maximum error (95\% confidence) is 1.52 \%. The accuracy of measurement of the present method is better than gravimetric one which accounts 4 \% of error on average.},

The accuracy of calculation result are heavily depends on the reaction mechanism selection and parameter adjustment. All obtained result will be compared with ENDF nuclear data library.

As an application, we apply this formalism to study cosmology. In respect to standard effective Friedmann equations on the brane, Lorentz invariance violation in the bulk causes a modification of this equations that can lead to significant physical consequences. In particular, the effective Friedmann equation on the brane explicitly depends on the equation of state of the brane matter and the Lorentz violating parameters. We show that the components of five-dimensional Weyl curvature are related to the matter on brane even at low energies. We also find that the constraints on the theory parameters are depend on the equation of state of the energy components of the brane matter.

	abstract = {Dynamical study of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) showed that the  orbital evolution of TNOs, especially for Scattered-Disk class, is closely related to Centaurs. As of 1 June 2009,  there were 673 known Centaurs and TNOs whose orbits are well-determined within an uncertainty of  6.4 /decade. It is interesting to investigate a fraction of evolving Centaurs and TNOs to inner solar system regions along 1 Myr evolution under perturbations of all planets. In order to have a  better knowledge about spatial distributions of Centaurs and TNOs, we generated additional four sets artificial data based on the known distribution. We find that most Centaurs show chaotic orbital evolutions and many of them are ejected out to the outer solar system. The ejected Centaurs in the first-half evolution are more numerous than that of the second-half one. This study also indicates that number of Centaurs originated from 3:2 Neptune resonance objects is more abundant at about 5  105 yr, and only {\textasciitilde}1\% Centaurs and TNOs evolve to be Mars-crossers.

Characterizations of poly(urethane-ester) were carried out by analysis of functional groups (FTIR), thermal properties (DTA/TGA), mechanical properties (Tensile tester), crystallinity (XRD), and biodegradability. The chain length of prepolymers used in polymerization has a significant effect in properties of poly(urethane-ester) as well as their biodegradability. The formation of poly(urethane-ester) was indicated by the presence of new absorption peaks at wave number of 3,348.2 and 1,596.9 cm−1 for urethane (–NH–) and aromatic groups in chain of polymers, respectively. The increase chain length of prepolymer used in polymerization with 4,4′-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) was observed the increase thermal property and crystallinity of poly(urethane-ester). However, the maximum mechanical property and also biodegradability in activated sludge were observed in poly(urethane-ester) prepared by polymerization of 4,4′-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) (MDI) and P(CL-DP) prepolymers with DP/CL ratio of 1/20. Apparently, the amorphous parts of polymers are rapidly decomposed by enzymes of microorganisms, so the crystallinity on the whole of poly(urethane-ester) increases after incubation time of 30 days.},

The electron effective mass in the oxide and the electron phase velocity in the n+ poly-Si gate are the only two fitting parameters to compare calculated tunneling currents to measured ones. It was obtained that the calculated tunneling currents fit well to the measured ones. The electron effective mass in the oxide layer tends to increase with decreasing the oxide thickness.

Exponential and Airy wavefunctions were utilized to obtain the electron transmittance and the electron tunneling current. A transfer matrix method, as a numerical approach, was used as a benchmark to assess the analytical approaches. It was found that there is a similarity in the transmittances calculated among exponential- and Airy-wavefunction approaches and the TMM at low electron energies. However, for high energies, only the transmittance calculated by using the Airy-wavefunction approach is the same as that evaluated by the TMM. It was also found that only the tunneling currents calculated by using the Airy-wavefunction approach are the same as those obtained under the TMM for all range of oxide voltages. Therefore, a better analytical description for the tunneling phenomenon in the MOS capacitor is given by the Airy-wavefunction approach. Moreover, the tunneling current density decreases as the titanium concentration of the TiN x metal gate increases because the electron effective mass of TiN x decreases with increasing nitrogen concentration. In addition, the mass anisotropy cannot be neglected because the tunneling currents obtained under the isotropic and anisotropic masses are very different.},

The gate electron and substrate hole velocities are 1×105 m/s independent of the HfSiOxN thickness.

We can connect the system (A, B, C) with its reciprocal system via the solutions of the Lyapunov equations. The realization of the reciprocal system is reduced by balanced truncation. This result is further translated using reciprocal transformation as the reduced -order model for the systems (A, B, C). Then the low order controller is designed based on the reduced order model.

Based on this theory we investigate the Kaluza-Klein two-brane-worlds cosmology at low energy, in both the static and the nonstatic internal dimensions. In the case of the static internal dimensions, the effective gravitational constant in the induced Friedmann equation depends on the equations of state of the brane matter, and the dark radiation term naturally appears. In the nonstatic case we take a relation between the external and internal scale factors of the form b(t)=aγ(t) in which the brane world evolves with two scale factors. In this case, the induced Friedmann equation on the brane is modified in the effective gravitational constant and the term proportional to a−4β. For dark radiation, we find γ=−2/(1+n). Finally, we discuss the issue of conformal frames which naturally arises with scalar-tensor theories. We find that the static internal dimensions in the Jordan frame may become nonstatic in the Einstein frame.},

SEM-EDX analyses infer that the main magnetic minerals in the leachate sludge are iron oxides. In terms of their morphology, the grains from Jelekong are mostly octahedral and angular, which are similar to the general shapes of magnetic grains from the local soils. The grains from Sarimukti, on the other hand, are dominated by imperfect spherule shapes suggesting the product of combustion processes. Hysteresis parameters verify that the predominant magnetic mineral in leachate sludge is low coercivity ferrimagnetic mineral such as magnetite (Fe3O4). Furthermore, comparisons of rock magnetic parameters show that the magnetic minerals of soil samples from Jelekong have higher degree of magnetic pedogenesis indicating higher proportion of superparamagnetic/ultrafine particles than those of soil samples from Sarimukti. The plot of susceptibilities ratio versus coercive force has a great potential to be used as a discriminating tool for determining the source of magnetic minerals.},

	abstract = {The effect of the carbon source on the optimization of the photoluminescence (PL) performance of boron carbon oxynitride (BCNO) phosphor particles was systematically investigated. Ethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol (TEG), and poly(ethylene glycol) of various Mw values were used as the organic sources. When TEG was used, the BCNO phosphors exhibited high PL performance under excitation at 365 nm with a quantum efficiency of up to 60\%. The emission spectrum peak of the prepared BCNO particles was affected by the Mw of the carbon sources. An additional study investigated in detail the effects of the carbon/boron and nitrogen/boron molar ratios on PL properties. The emission spectra with a wavelength peak ranging from 380 nm (near UV) to 570 nm (near red) could be adjusted by varying the carbon/boron or nitrogen/boron ratios.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been increasing demand on finding new solid electrolytes based on glassy material, due to their potential applications for solid state rechargeable battery. Superionic conducting glasses have many advantageous compared with the crystalline, or composite electrolytes, such as easy in preparation, low melting point, no grain broundary, wide composition range and easy to be formed as thin film. Among superionic glasses, the family of silver phosphate glasses (AgI) x (AgPO 3 ) 1- x  and lithium phosphate glasses (LiI) x (LiPO 3 ) 1- x , are the most interested materials to be investigated. Many experiments have been performed to investigate the properties of those materials. This paper will review the recent results of the lithium glasses (LiI) x (LiPO 3 ) 1- x , such as the preparation, appearance, structure, electrical, and thermal properties. The x-ray data shows the precipitate occured at  x =0.4, indicating the solubility limit of (LiI) x (LiPO 3 ) 1- x  was reached at this composition. The microstructure data observed by SEM showed the different area between the smooth surface for  x =0.3 and appearance of cluster at  x =0.4. Comparison between glassy LiPO 3  and (LiI) 0.3 (LiPO 3 ) 1- x  as the result of Raman spectra analysis, suggested a new feature at around 1000 cm -1 , indicating the depolymerization of the non bridging oxygen, due to the presence of LiI component. The room temperature conductivities of (LiI) x (LiPO 3 ) 1- x  with  x =0.3 and 0.4 are 2.7 ×10 -6  and 8.8 ×10 -7  S/cm, respectively, which are 3 orders of magnitudes higher than the undoped glass LiPO 3 . In general, the silver glass has better ionic conductivity than the lithium glass; but in application the lithium battery has better performance and produces higher voltage.},

	abstract = {A closed-loop temperature control system, which is composed of a thermal plant and a controller, has been developed to support undergraduate students in learning automatic control delivered in the Special Topics in Instrumentation Physics course. The thermal plant was made from a plastic box covering a lamp and a fan, which heats and drains the air in the plastic box, respectively, as well as a temperature sensor. The controller with a proportional control action was realized by employing the PIC 16F877 microcontroller. The control signal updates pulse-width modulators (PWMs) in which driver circuits turn on or off the lamp and the fan. A mathematical model of the closed-loop control system was derived and a theoretical transient response was then obtained. It is found that the experimental transient responses were always much lower than the set point and the steady-state errors were high for the proportional sensitivity (KP) lower than 10. For KP higher than 10, the transient responses tend to approach the set point to cause small steady-state errors. These characteristics are consistent with the theoretical transient response. Further examination revealed that the closed-loop system is a higher order system due to the action of the PWMs and the driver circuits. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The model reconstruction is based on crystallite properties and diagenetic parameters determined from two-dimensional images. The three-dimensional pore scale microstructure of the sandstone is represented by a list of quartz crystallites defined geometrically and placed in the continuum. This allows generation of synthetic μ-CT images of the rock model at arbitrary resolutions. Quantitative microstructure comparison based on Minkowski functionals, two-point correlation function and local porosity theory indicates that this modeling technique can provide more realistic and accurate models of sandstones than many existing techniques used currently. Synthetic μ-CTimages at different resolutions from a laboratory scale model of Fontainebleau sandstone are made available to the scientific community for resolution dependent petrophysical analysis.},

The strength of the magnetodielectric coupling in this system can be explained by spin–orbit coupling.

The adsorption capacity for phyrophyllite was found to increase with decrease in particle size and with increase in temperature and intensity of agitation.

The influence of several parameters (pH, alkyl chain length, concentration of the ion pair reagent) has been studied to determine the best chromatographic conditions. Methods: Separation of the three organotin compounds was achieved on a C8-bonded silica column using a mixture of methanol, water, and acetic acid (80:19:1) as eluent, containing 1 mmol/L decane sulfonic acid as ion pairing reagent. The eluates were detected on-line by hydride generation-quartz furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry (HG-QFAAS). Results: The resolving power of this developed method for separation of the organotins species at above conditions was shown by the values of fundamental chromatographic parameters. The capacity factors (k’) for DBT, TBT and TPhT species were 0.27, 2.54, and 5.92 respectively. Resolution (Rs) values for DBT-TBT and TBT-TPhT separation were 2.92 and 2.42 respectively, while the selectivity for DBT-TBT and TBT-TPhT were 9.76 and 3.50 respectively. Conclusion: The developed IP-RP-HG-QFAAS chromatography technique can separate DBT, TBT, and TPhT with good performance which is shown by the chromatographic parameters produced.},

	abstract = {An experimental system for the study of ion-induced nucleation in a SO2/H2O/N2 gas mixture was developed, employing a soft x-ray at different pressure and temperature levels. The difficulties associated with these experiments included the changes in physical properties of the gas mixture when temperature and pressure were varied. Changes in the relative humidity (RH) as a function of pressure and temperature also had a significant effect on the different behaviors of the mobility distributions of particles. In order to accomplish reliable measurement and minimize uncertainties, an integrated on-line control system was utilized. As the pressure decreased in a range of 500–980 hPa, the peak concentration of both ions and nanometer-sized particles decreased, which suggests that higher pressure tended to enhance the growth of particles nucleated by ion-induced nucleation. Moreover, the modal diameters of the measured particle size distributions showed a systematic shift to larger sizes with increasing pressure. However, in the temperature range of 5–20 °C, temperature increases had no significant effects on the mobility distribution of particles. The effects of residence time, RH (7\%–70\%), and SO2 concentration (0.08–6.7 ppm) on ion-induced nucleation were also systematically investigated. The results show that the nucleation and growth were significantly dependent on the residence time, RH, and SO2 concentration, which is in agreement with both a previous model and previous observations. This research will be inevitable for a better understanding of the role of ions in an atmospheric nucleation mechanism.},

Control of particle size was accomplished mainly by changing the concentration of the reactants, which could be qualitatively explained by conventional nucleation theory. Flexibility of the process in controlling particle morphology, from a spherical to a cubical form, was predominantly achieved by varying the concentration of MgCl2. Since the same XRD pattern was detected in particles with varying morphologies, the shape transformation was due to changes in particle growth.

The hybrid polymer precursors were prepared from ester-modified silicon alkoxide by using sol–gel technique. The gel precursor can be then polymerized into a solid film by photo-polymerization. The gratings were fabricated by interference laser technique by employing Lloyd's mirror configuration. The Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) image shows the formation of corrugated grating structure. Although the grating depth is relatively shallow compared to the thickness of the layer, the photo-pumped lasing action has been observed in those structures. In a film without grating structure, only Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) was observed.},

	abstract = {A hierarchically porous siliceous MFI zeolite (silicalite-1) with narrow mesoporosity has been hydrothermally synthesized by using trialkoxysilylated alkyl poly(oxyethylene ether) as mesopore-directing agent. A mesostructured silica−surfactant composite was formed at the early stage of the reaction, and zeolite crystallization proceeded during subsequent hydrothermal treatment. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of the crystallized products showed that micro- and mesopores were hierarchically assembled in unique particle morphology with rugged surfaces. Solid-state 29Si and 13C NMR revealed that the covalent bonds between the zeolite framework and mesopore-directing agent were present in the products before calcination. The use of nonsilylated alkyl poly(oxyethylene ether) or a silylated alkytrimethyl-ammonium-type cationic surfactant for the synthesis of silicalite-1 resulted in a mixture of mesoporous silica and zeolite as the final product, which suggests that the covalent interaction and nonelectrostatic charge matching interaction favor the formation of hierarchically mesoporous siliceous zeolite. This alkoxysilylated nonionic surfactant can also be extended to synthesize aluminosilicate MFI zeolite (ZSM-5).},

The flexible structure has six degrees of freedom and the control system is designed by using the HÂ¿-control theory. The passive control is to minimize the HÂ¿-norm from closed loop transfer function of the system which implies suppressing the magnitude peaks vibration of the frequency response. Parameters optimization of flexible structure system becomes an HÂ¿-output feedback problem. This problem is transformed to Bilinear Matrix Inequality problem and then it is solved by using GA. The GA is distinguished by their parallel investigation of several areas of a search space simultaneously to locate a global extreme by manipulating a population with randomized operators. The numerical simulations are conducted for examining the performance of the passive control. From this result, we can conclude that the GA is better than Nguyen method.},

There is a threshold number that determinewhether the diseases become epidemic or not. It depends on three parameters: theaverage length of the infective period, the contact parameter, and the density ofsusceptible population at the initial time. With di®usive terms in the model, thespatial spread of the infection is obvious. Threshold number greater than one isalso the necessary condition for the spreading of infection in the form of a travelingpulse. Its minimum velocity can be determined. We implement the MacCormackmethod, and simulate the generation of a traveling pulse starting from one infectedbird. Numerically, we obtain the percentage of survival in °ock and human afterthe epidemic. We also simulate the minimal portion of immunization in order toprevent further spread.

The main goal is to determine the optimum gas injection rate for each well that maximizing the total oil production rate. The total gas for injection is constrained by the maximum availability and the total liquid production rate is constrained by separator capacity. The mathematical model for gas lift problem could be written as a boundary value problem, where the two parameter family non linear differential equation of the boundary value problem represents steady flow equation along the tubing, satisfying wellhead pressure and bottom hole pressure as boundary conditions. Oil production rate is a non-linear function of gas injection rate, which is given implicitly from the gas lift model. A computation scheme based on genetic algorithms is developed to solve the constrained optimization problem with and without considering separator capacity. Our results show quite good estimation for optimum solution. This approach is also flexible to accommodate separator capacity constraints.},

The root-mean-square fluctuation's and snapshot analysis showed that the fingers and thumb subdomains are the most flexible regions. Further analysis based on principal component and cross-correlation to the MD trajectory showed that 3'→5' exonuclease and 5'→3' polymerase domains exhibited anticorrelated motion. Furthermore, the communication between residues belonged to the 3'→5' exonuclease domain appeared as correlated motion, in contrast to the residues inside 5'→3' polymerase domain represented by thumb and fingers subdomains showed anticorrelated motion. In addition, the surface electrostatic potential analysis showed that the interface between thumb and fingers subdomains has positive charges, this might due to caused repulsion of the subdomains resulting periodical motion even without substrates.},

In the present study, a local blockage accident analysis of Pb-Bi-cooled long-life fast reactors has been performed. In this analysis, we consider two models. In the first model, we consider that the cross-flow can only come from two nearby channels. In the second model, we consider that the cross-flow can come from four nearby channels.

For steady laminar flow, its velocity profile is parabolic. For flow in porous media between two stationary parallel plates, the results show that medium permeability depends on porosity and obstacle configurations. For a single obstacle, the permeability is a parabolic function with respect to positions of an obstacle in the direction perpendicular to the flow. The permeability is smallest when the obstacle is at the central line along the flow. A maximum permeability may be achieved when the obstacles attached to the channel wall.

It indicates a shorter reactor operation time is obtained for loading MA than without loading MA. Conversion rasio level or breeding rasio, is obtained less conversion rasio for loading MA which shows less fissile material production when some portion of U-238 is replaced by MA loading. Although, during reactor operation, some fissile plutonium materials such as Pu-239 are also produced from MA loading, however, it still less production in comparing with fissile plutonium production from direct process from converted U-238. It shows more Pu-238 can be produced than Pu-240 because of main portion of MA is Np-237 which can be directly produce more Pu-238 than Pu- 240.

Minor actinide (MA) inventory compositions obtain a different inventory trends at equilibrium composition for both fuel types. Higher Inventory of MA is obtained by MOX fuel and less MA inventory for TRU fuel at equilibrium composition than initial composition. Some different MA inventories can be estimated from the different inventory trend of americium (Am). Higher americium inventory for MOX fuel and less americium inventory for TRU fuel at equilibrium condition. Breeding ratio of TRU fuel is relatively higher compared with MOX fuel type. It can be estimated from relatively higher production of Pu-238 (through converted MA) in TRU fuel, and Pu-238 converts through neutron capture to produce Pu-239. Higher breeding ratio of MOX fuel and TRU fuel types at equilibrium condition are estimated from converted fertile material during reactor operation into fissile material of plutonium such as converted uranium fuel (converted U-238 into Pu-239) or additional converted fuel from MA into Pu-238 and changes into Pu-239 by capturing neutron. Loading LWR SF gives better fuel breeding capability and increase inventory of MA for doping material of MOX fuel; however, it requires more supply MA inventory for TRU fuel type.},

	abstract = {Some interesting issues are attributed to nuclide compositions of spent fuels from thermal reactors as well as fast reactors such as a potential to reuse as recycled fuel, and a possible capability to be manage as a fuel for destructive devices. In addition, analysis on nuclear forensics which is related to spent fuel compositions becomes one of the interesting topics to evaluate the origin and the composition of spent fuels from the spent fuel foot-prints. Spent fuel compositions of different fuel types give some typical spent fuel foot prints and can be estimated the origin of source of those spent fuel compositions. Some technics or methods have been developing based on some science and technological capability including experimental and modeling or theoretical aspects of analyses. Some foot-print of nuclear forensics will identify the typical information of spent fuel compositions such as enrichment information, burnup or irradiation time, reactor types as well as the cooling time which is related to the age of spent fuels. This paper intends to evaluate the typical spent fuel compositions of light water (LWR) and fast breeder reactors (FBR) from the view point of some foot prints of nuclear forensics. An established depletion code of ORIGEN is adopted to analyze LWR spent fuel (SF) for several burnup constants and decay times. For analyzing some spent fuel compositions of FBR, some coupling codes such as SLAROM code, JOINT and CITATION codes including JFS-3-J-3.2R as nuclear data library have been adopted. Enriched U-235 fuel composition of oxide type is used for fresh fuel of LWR and a mixed oxide fuel (MOX) for FBR fresh fuel. Those MOX fuels of FBR come from the spent fuels of LWR. Some typical spent fuels from both LWR and FBR will be compared to distinguish some typical foot-prints of SF based on nuclear forensic analysis.},

Each fuel core regions are subdivided into ten parts (region-1 until region-10) with the same volume in the axial direction.

	abstract = {he determination of Sn(II) ion at trace levels using integrated gas-liquid separator-reactor with hydride generation-quartz furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer (HG-QFAAS) has been done. This modified gas-liquid separator at various sizes was able to increase sensitivity in the determination of Sn(II) in solution. The acid reagent mixing techniques, sample and reductant optimally occurs in a coil reaction before they are going to the gas-liquid separators. The optimum conditions of parameter measurement in the determination of Sn ion with HG method are influenced by type and concentration of acid, and the concentration of reductant has been evaluated. This optimum parameters can increase of analytical performance simultantly, which is shown by detection limit 3.74 mg L-1 for 100 mL injection volume (3.74 pg Sn). The accuracy of measurement shown by the \% recovery of the Sn determination in natural water sample at {\textgreater} 95\%, indicate this technique is good to be applied for tin analysis at picogram level.},

	abstract = {Migration is important issue for seismic imaging in complex structure. In this decade, depth imaging becomes important tools for producing accurate image in depth imaging instead of time domain imaging. The challenge of depth migration method, however, is in revealing the complex structure of subsurface. There are many methods of depth migration with their advantages and weaknesses. In this paper, we show our propose method of pre-stack depth migration based on time domain inverse scattering wave equation. Hopefully this method can be as solution for imaging complex structure in Indonesia, especially in rich thrusting fault zones. In this research, we develop a recent advance wave equation migration based on time domain inverse scattering wave which use more natural wave propagation using scattering wave. This wave equation pre-stack depth migration use time domain inverse scattering wave equation based on Helmholtz equation. To provide true amplitude recovery, an inverse of divergence procedure and recovering transmission loss are considered of pre-stack migration. Benchmarking the propose inverse scattering pre-stack depth migration with the other migration methods are also presented, i.e.: wave equation pre-stack depth migration, waveequation depth migration, and pre-stack time migration method. This inverse scattering pre-stack depth migration could image successfully the rich fault zone which consist extremely dip and resulting superior quality of seismic image. The image quality of inverse scattering migration is much better than the others migration methods.},

Also, different organs and tissues have very similar gray levels, which consign thresholding to limited utility. We have been developed a new software to solve different registration and segmentation problems that arises in tomographic data sets. It will be demonstrated that the information obtained by SPECT/CT is more accurate in evaluating patients/objects than that obtained from either SPECT or CT alone. We used multi-modality registration which is amenable for images produced by different modalities and having unclear boundaries between tissues. The segmentation components used in this software is region growing algorithms which have proven to be an effective approach for image segmentation.

This theory is limited by certain modelling assumptions, which may not always valid. The discrete form of the Kalman filter is then used to generate an estimate of the reflectivity function. The main advantage of Kalman filtering is capability of technique to handling continually time varying models and has high resolution capabilities. In this work, we use discrete Kalman filter that it was combined with primitive deconvolution. Filtering process works on reflectivity function, hence the work flow of filtering is started with primitive deconvolution using inverse of wavelet. The seismic signals then are obtained by convoluting of filtered reflectivity function with energy waveform which is referred to as the seismic wavelet. The higher frequency of wavelet gives smaller wave length, the graphs of these results are presented.},

From those four horizontal layers the lowest layer is defined as the floor. The left wall and the floor layers consist of fixed grains, while the other three layers are filled with movable grains. In the most top horizontal layer a particular grain is subjected to weighting process. It has been observed that during 200 s simulation time a micro-lanslide can occur if the minimum weighting is about 96 times of the original mass of the grain. As the weighting increasing the time needed for the micro-lanslide to emerge is decreasing. The position of the weighted grain is also play a role in introducing a micro-lanslide, the nearer the grain to the left wall the larger the time needed for the micro-lanslide to occur.},

Therefore, wave propagation phenomena in pore media is important to be studied. By referring this study, in-direct pore measurement method based on seismic wave propagation can be developed. Porosity play important role in reservoir, because the porosity can be as compartment of fluid. Many type of porosity like primary as well as secondary porosity. Carbonate rock consist many type of porosity, i.e.: inter granular porosity, moldic porosity and also fracture porosity. The complexity of pore type in carbonate rocks make the wave propagation in these rocks is more complex than sand reservoir. We have studied numerically wave propagation in carbonate rock by finite difference modeling in time-space domain. The medium of wave propagation was modeled by base on the result of pattern recognition using artificial neural network. The image of thin slice of carbonate rock is then translated into the velocity matrix. Each mineral contents including pore of thin slice image are translated to velocity since mineral has unique velocity. After matrix velocity model has been developed, the seismic wave is propagated numerically in this model. The phenomena diffraction is clearly shown while wave propagates in this complex carbonate medium. The seismic wave is modeled in various frequencies. The result shows dispersive phenomena where high frequency wave tends to propagate in matrix instead pores. In the other hand, the low frequency waves tend to propagate through pore space even though the velocity of pore is very low. Therefore, this dispersive phenomena of seismic wave propagation can be the future indirect measurement technology for predicting the existence or intensity of pore space in reservoir rock. It will be very useful for the future reservoir characterization.},

Assuming that magma chamber follows the Mogi point source model and implementing the Levenberg-Marquardt inversion scheme, Bouger anomaly data are intepreted to predict the existance of shallow magma chamber beneath a fumarolic area of a volcano. Changes in subsurface condition are related to the deformation of magma chamber or dynamic of the associated hydrothermal. The inversion scheme was applied to synthetic data and yielded acceptable results. Since currently we have no field data, the implementation to real data was conducted by applying the scheme to microgravity data recorded at Merapi volcano during 1993-1995 activity published by Jousset et al. in 2000 [1] and Gunawan [2] . The interpreted gravity anomaly indicates that a causative body which depth and dimension are comparable to those concluded from seismic survey (depth 2000 m and 600-800 m radius) was the caused of the anomaly. Inversion of microgravity data recorded at different time yields the estimated volume and depth of change involved within the very shallow depth during the summit activity.},

	abstract = {Magnetotelluric (MT) is one of the geophysical methods which are used in mapping subsurface resistivity distribution of the earth by utilizing electromagnetic (EM) wave as an energy source. Through the measurement of electric and magnetic field in orthogonal direction above the surface of the earth, resistivity distribution of the subsurface can be mapped while the penetration depth depends on the frequency of the EM wave. In many cases, three-dimensional resistivity structures are often approximated by two-dimensional models without checking the dimensionality of the structure prior to perform modeling. However, such approximation can be misleading if the structure is purely 3D where electromagnetic fields can not be separated into TE and TM modes. To overcome this problem, a dimensionality analysis is important in order to get the general feature of the structure in particular in 3D structure as expected in volcanic area. There are many methods to analyze dimensionality of the resistivity structure such as Bahr’s method and Groom-Bailey decompositions, which assume that the regional structure is two-dimensional. Here, we examine the dimensionality analyses using the phase tensor and induction vector, which is no assumption of two-dimensional for regional structure. The parameter “beta” is also used as an index of three-dimensionality of the structure. The resistivity value and area of the synthetic model were made as close as possible to the real volcanic structure in order to confirm the ability of this method in volcanic region. We also applied this method to the real magnetotelluric data collected from volcanic zone. The result shows that the volcanic region is electrically dominated by 3D structure at shallow part where conductive zone with circle-like shape exists in the middle of the model. The pure 2D structure was found at the deep part of the model.},

With the length of 1900 km, Sumatran fault was divided into 20 segments starting from the southernmost Sumatra Island having small slip rate and increasing to the north end of Sumatra Island. There are several geophysical methods to analyze fault structure depending on physical parameter used in these methods, such as seismology, geodesy and electromagnetic. Magnetotelluric method which is one of geophysical methods has been widely used in mapping and sounding resistivity distribution because it does not only has the ability for detecting contras resistivity but also has a penetration range up to hundreds of kilometers. Magnetotelluric survey was carried out in Aceh region with the 12 total sites crossing Sumatran Fault on Aceh and Seulimeum segments. Two components of electric and magnetic fields were recorded during 10 hours in average with the frequency range from 320 Hz to 0,01 Hz. Analysis of the pseudosection of phase and apparent resistivity exhibit vertical low phase flanked on the west and east by high phase describing the existence of resistivity contras in this region. Having rotated the data to N45°E direction, interpretation of the result has been performed using three different methods of 1D MT modeling i.e. Bostick inversion, 1D MT inversion of TM data, and 1D MT inversion of the impedance determinant. By comparison, we concluded that the use of TM data only and the impedance determinant in 1D inversion yield the more reliable resistivity structure of the fault compare to other methods. Based on this result, it has been shown clearly that Sumatra Fault is characterized by vertical contras resistivity indicating the existence of Aceh and Seulimeum faults which has a good agreement with the geological data.},

We have undertaken several geophysical measurements in period of 2008 - 2011 including magnetotelluric, gravity, magnetic and DC resistivity in order to delineate subsurface structure of the volcano. Magnetotelluric measurement was designed using a grid system with the 30 sites and interval station of approximately 250m covering the summit area. Frequency range from 320 Hz to 1 HZ were used in MT measurement by recording two components of electric and magnetic fields using phoenix MTU-5 system. Magnetic and gravity data were acquired in the summit area overlapping with the MT survey to determine basement of the volcano structure. The shallow resistivity structure was constrained by two lines DC resistivity survey that was carried out in east-west direction located in the center of the summit to confirm the thickness of pyroclastic distribution released from 2002 eruption. The MT result derived from 3D inversion shows that the resistive zone of deep structure with the circle-like shape exists in the middle of the model in coincidence with the location of new craters. A comparison of low total magnetic field appear to be consistent with the circle-like shaped resistive zone presumably related to high temperature distributed in center of the region.

The simulation performed to calculate the generation rate which is a function of the effective band gap dan the absorption coefficient value of the material has been done with 3 variations of germanium composition and 4 variations of quantum dot size. The performance of SiGe with 50\% of Germanium composition will be compared with pure Silicon and pure Germanium while the variations of quantum dot size used are 1nm, 2nm, 3nm and 4nm. Simulation results show that increasing numbers of Germanium atoms within the material combined with larger size of quantum dot leads to higher generation rate and helps broadening the range of photon energy which can contribute on the creation of electron-hole pair. Adding Ge into Si quantum dot is found to be effective to increase the generation rate of electrons and holes.},

This parameter is determined from temperature measurements in the IR3 channel (water vapour, 6.7 μm) for high-altitude clouds (cirrus), and from the IR1 channel (10.7 μm) for lower-altitude clouds. An algorithm is developed to detect the corresponding clouds. The results of this study were used to select the best possible sites in Indonesia, which will be analysed further by performing in situ measurements in the future. The results suggest that regions of East Nusa Tenggara, located in southeastern Indonesia, are the most promising candidates for such an astronomical site. The yearly clear sky fraction of this region may reach better than 70 per cent, with an uncertainty of 10 per cent.},

	abstract = {On February 2012, two stellar occultation's by large Trans-neptunian
Objects (TNO's) were observed by our group. On the 3rd, an event by
(208996) 2003 AZ84 was recorded from Mont Abu Observatory and IUCAA
Girawali Observatory in India and from Weizmann Observatory in Israel.
On the 17th, a stellar occultation by (50000) Quaoar was observed from
south France and Switzerland. Both occultations are the second observed
by our group for each object, and will be used to improve the results
obtained on the previous events. The occultation by 2003 AZ84 is the
first multi-chord event recorded for this object. From the single chord
event on January 8th 2011, Braga-Ribas et al. 2011 obtained a lower
limit of 573 +/- 21 km. From the 2012 occultation the longest chord has
a size of 662 +/- 50 km. The other chords will permit to determine the
size and shape of the TNO, and derive other physical parameters, such as
the geometric albedo. The Quaoar occultation was observed from south of
France (Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, TAROT telescope and
Valensole) and from Gnosca, Switzerland. Unfortunately, all three sites
in France are almost at the same Quaoar's latitude, so in practice, we
have two chords that can be used to fit Quaoar's limb. The resulting fit
will be compared with the results obtained by Braga-Ribas et al. 2011.

The research project will study and develop some additional observing tools, image acquisition and image processing procedures for mobile and robotic observing system that one enable to search the very young crescent in broad daylight. The main problem is how to minimize the atmospheric and instrumental stray light that can obscure the information from the very young crescent image from the daylight background. We have developed and tested a simple extended telescope baffle that can reduce the incoming stray light from the sky and environment. Hence, it will increase the contrast of the lunar crescent. Some requirements and optimization have been applied for the robotic observing system (telescope and its mounting), image acquisition and image processing procedures.

The wave file is then processed to obtain the signal period as a function of time by timing all zero crossings. From the obtained signal period as a function of time, an average value of the period is calculated. Using the calculated average period, it was found that the gravitational acceleration is (9.77 ± 0.03) m s −2 . Noting that the G-type La Coste \& Romberg G928 gravimeter obtains a gravitational acceleration of 9.78 m s −2 , the present method offers very good accuracy, with a percentage error of about 0.1\%.},

It is found that those parameters exhibit roughly linear and mostly monotonous variations at the lower resonance. The reduction of the group velocity and enhancement of energy confinement are also shown to be effectively attained by increasing N, while leaving the loss parameter relatively unaffected. On the other hand, the calculated results for the upper resonance wavelength are shown to exhibit consistently non-monotonous responses to increasing g. Similarly distinct behaviors are also found in the relationship between the minimum group velocity (vg, min) and the energy loss (L) as well as that between vg, min and the confined energy (W) for various N and g at the upper resonances. This peculiarly different behaviors are shown to be related to the variations of the associated local density of states with respect to N and g calculated for the upper resonance.},

However, for a specific choice of the system parameters leading to a photonic crystals of hollow dielectric rods, both TE and TM photonic band structures feature perceptible band gaps with significant overlap, yielding effective complete photonic band gaps (CPBG).

Such is the case for Ba3CuSb2O9, which is magnetically anisotropic at the atomic scale but curiously isotropic on mesoscopic length and time scales. We find that the frustration of Wannier’s Ising model on the triangular lattice is imprinted in a nanostructured honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ ions that resists a coherent static Jahn-Teller distortion. The resulting two-dimensional random-bond spin-1/2 system on the honeycomb lattice has a broad spectrum of spin-dimer–like excitations and low-energy spin degrees of freedom that retain overall hexagonal symmetry.
Magnetic measurements indicate that a material remains disordered to millikelvin temperatures, thanks to its unusual lattice structure.

Comparison with theoretical predictions based on either rigid orbital order or strong orbital fluctuations clearly rules out that orbital fluctuations are strong in RVO3.

Here we use broadband ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy in the visible range to study low-energy transitions across the Mott-Hubbard gap in the orbitally ordered insulator YVO3. Separating thermal and nonthermal contributions to the optical transients, we show that the total spectral weight of the two lowest peaks is conserved, demonstrating that both excitations correspond to the same multiplet. The pump-induced transfer of spectral weight between the two peaks reveals that the low-energy one is a Hubbard exciton, i.e., a resonance or a nearly bound state between a doublon and a holon. Finally, we speculate that the pump-driven spin disorder can be used to quantify the kinetic energy gain of the excitons in a ferromagnetic environment.},

The molecular structure characterization results show the formation of inorganic networks within the precursor gel, which further undergoes the formation of organic–inorganic polymer network by photopolymerization. The laser interference was performed by using the frequency-tripled output of nanosecond Nd–YAG laser. The fabricated DFB gratings exhibit photopumped lasing actions with high consistency between the grating periodicity (between 380 and 1030 nm) and the lasing wavelength, which appears at the wavelength of the second-order Bragg reflection. The atomic force microcopy measurements clearly show the formation of surface relief (corrugated) structure in those gratings. The mechanism of surface relief formation is attributed to a fast photo-induced swelling process, which is unique property belonging to this kind of hybrid polymer precursor gel.

The surface plasmon polaritons that occur on the metallic grating surface were excited by a He-Ne laser of 633 nm wavelength. The effect of the grating was investigated by angle-resolved reflection and emission spectroscopy performed on the thin film samples with and without the grating. Incident light of both s- and p-polarizations were considered in this experiment and the measurement was performed in the reflection and the photoluminescence modes as well. The results exhibit remarkable resonant effect of photoluminescence enhancement over those observed from the sample with planar silver coating for both incident light polarizations. The much larger enhancement factor of {\textasciitilde}50.0 found for the case of p-polarized light can be attributed to the combined contributions of surface plasmon polariton enhanced absorption of excitation light and the resonant coupling between the SPP and the fluorophore, while only the latter was operating in the case of s-polarized incident light which showed a smaller enhancement factor of 6.0.},

The very large intensity enhancement is obtained over those detected with single pulse operation without generating the He plasma. It is most remarkable that the same sharpness and intensity enhancement observed in the previous double pulse experiment with 37mJ laser ablation energy is achieved in the present experiment with much lower ablation energy of merely 2.5mJ, resulting in average crater size of about 10μm in diameter.

The existing standard method requires a tedious, destructive, and costly sample preparation process involving the removal of the remaining fuel in the vessel and melting away part of the zircaloy pipe. An alternative method of orthogonal dual-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) is proposed by employing flowing atmospheric helium gas without the use of a sample chamber. The special setup of ps and ns laser systems, operated for the separate ablation of the sample target and the generation of helium gas plasma, respectively, with properly controlled relative timing, has succeeded in producing the desired sharp D I 656.10 nm emission line with effective suppression of the interfering H I 656.28 nm emission by operating the ps ablation laser at very low output energy of 26 mJ and 1 μs ahead of the helium plasma generation. Under this optimal experimental condition, a linear calibration line is attained with practically zero intercept and a 20 μg/g detection limit for D analysis of zircaloy sample while creating a crater only 10 μm in diameter. Therefore, this method promises its potential application for the practical, in situ, and virtually nondestructive quantitative microarea analysis of D, thereby supporting the more-efficient operation and maintenance of heavy-water nuclear power plants. Furthermore, it will also meet the anticipated needs of future nuclear fusion power plants, as well as other important fields of application in the foreseeable future.},

One promising low-cost material for manufacturing porous ceramics as water filter is clay. Clays can be blended with other materials such as polymers to obtain functional ceramic materials. Approach: Ceramic wastewater filters were fabricated from clay using both sol-gel and simple mixing methods followed by hot-pressing and calcination. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) was used as a poreforming agent. Results: Varying the clay:PEG ratio modified the membrane permeability between 1.65×10 -16 m 2 and 3.16×10 -15 m 2 for the sol-gel membranes and between 1.38×10 -16 and 8.72×10 -13 m 2 for membranes prepared by simple mixing. The strength ranged from 0.28 MPa-1.71 MPa for the sol-gel membranes and from 0.05-0.90 MPa for samples prepared by simple mixing. The filtration performance was tested using aqueous solutions of Methylene Blue (MB). The concentrations of MB remaining in the solution varied from 0.98-1.44\% for sol-gel filters and from 1.50-38.05\% for filters prepared by simple mixing. Conclusion: We succeeded in making ceramic as filter from clay. The porous ceramic can be used to reducing concentration of pollutant simulated.

The transmittance was then applied to calculate tunneling currents in TiN/HfSiOxN/SiO2/p-Si MOS capacitors. The calculated results show that as the gate electron velocity increases, the transmittance decreases and therefore the tunneling current reduces. The tunneling current becomes lower as the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of HfSiOxN layer increases. When the incident electron passed through the barriers in the normal incident to the interface, the electron tunneling process becomes easier. It was also shown that the tunneling current was independent of the substrate orientation. Moreover, the model could be used in designing high speed MOS devices with low tunneling currents.},

A photocatalytic technique using semiconductor materials such as Titanium Dioxide (TiO 2) activated by lights has been considered as one economical method to solve this problem. Approach: We attached titanium dioxide on the surface of polymer grains as photocatalyc agents using a cylinder milling method. Photodegradation processes were observed in decomposition of Methylene Blue (MB) solutions, as waste model, under solar illumination. Several parameters were optimized such as the milling temperature, the milling period, number of coated grain layers on the surface of the waste. The repeatability of using the coated grains was also sipected. Results: Two layers of TiO 2 coated grains resulted the optimum decomposition rate of the MB solution. The milling temperature of 100°C and the milling period of 90 min produced the optimal decomposition rate. After five times repetition, the TiO 2 coated grains still function well by decomposition up to 97\% MB compound. Conclusion: These materials have the potential in large scale wastewater treatment in the tropical regions and nearly do not require a complicated late handling in the process of separating the catalyst for treated water as well as requires very small energy, expect the sunlight energy.},

To study the phenomena we calculated the diffusion coefficients, radial distribution functions and mean square displacement of iron, and also observed the micro-structure of iron before and after oxygen injection into coolant. The present calculation shows that a significant and effective reduction of corrosion can be achieved by injection of 7.68 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}-1.55 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} wt{\textbackslash}\% into coolant at temperature 750 °C. It is predicted that the lower limit of oxygen content, 7.68 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} wt{\textbackslash}\%, is the minimum value to develop a self-healing stable protective oxide film for preventing high dissolution of iron; and that the upper limit of oxygen content, 1.55 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} wt{\textbackslash}\%, is the maximum value in order to avoid the precipitation of coolant oxides. By injection of 7.68 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} wt{\textbackslash}\% of oxygen, the corrosion rate has been reduced about 92.16{\textbackslash}\% at 750 °C, and reduced by 98.66{\textbackslash}\% at the lower temperature 550 °C, compared with the normal, oxygenless condition.},

Three types of polymers, including polyethyleneimine (PEI), polyallylamine (PAA), and tetraethylene glycol (TEG) are used as carbon sources for the formation of BCNO phosphors. PEI is found to have the highest internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the three polymers because of its optimum thermal decomposition temperature and high exothermic energy during BCNO formation. The IQE of the BCNO phosphors prepared with PEI is 50\%, representing a 130\% increase over the value observed when TEG was used as the carbon source. In addition, the emission band of the BCNO phosphors can be tuned from 380 to 490 nm by varying the reaction temperature and polymer concentrations.},

In contrast, adding both PEG and urea to the precursor solution resulted in the formation of spherical particles. The spherical morphology was attributed to micellization by PEG and micelle agglomeration by urea in a liquid phase. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the spherical particles were of size around 5μm, and the obtained crystal was pure a YAG phase. The emission band of the YAG:Ce phosphor prepared at 1600°C for 2h was observed at 530nm under excitation at 470nm, and the maximum internal quantum efficiency was found to be 57.6\%.},

The reactor is tank type Pb-Bi cooled fast reactors with steam generator included inside reactor vessel. The simulation begin with steady state calculation of neutron flux, power distribution and temperature distribution across the core, hot and cool pool, and also steam generator. The accident analysis begin with the loss of pumping power. The sequence of analysis is then the transient flow calculation across the core, the core temperature distribution, hot pool and cool pool fluid dynamic calculation and temperature change simulation, and the transient flow and temperature calculation across the steam generator.

In this study the gas cooled reactor system is combined with modified CANDLE burn-up scheme to create long life fast reactors with natural uranium as fuel cycle input. Such a system can utilize natural uranium resources efficiently without the necessity of enrichment plant or reprocessing plant. Therefore, by using this type of nuclear power plants optimum nuclear energy utilization, including in developing countries, can be easily obtained without the problem of nuclear proliferation. In this paper, a design study of 800MWt long-life gas cooled fast reactors with natural uranium as fuel cycle input has been performed. Due to the thermal hydraulic constraints, the average power density of the proposed design is limited to 70W/cc. The system has excellent performance and is at least comparable to that of Pb–Bi cooled system. The average discharge burn-up is about 258GWd/ton HM.},

Four fuel cycle scenarios are evaluated and the comparison with once-through-cycle BWR was also conducted. The 1367 nuclides have been employed in the time independent burnup calculation scheme where 129 of them are heavy metals (HMs). The burnup code was facilitated with the calculation method for determining the required 233U concentration for criticality of the system inherently. The code was coupled with SRAC 2002 cell calculation code to compose a time independent-cell burnup code. In the cell calculation, 26 HMs, 66 fission products (FPs) and one pseudo FP have been utilized. The JENDL 3.2 library has been employed in this study. The results show that the profile of the required 233U concentration for criticality depends on the neutron spectra and the microscopic cross-section. However, the profile of the conversion ratio likely depends on the number density of heavy nuclides.},

In our previous study, we presented an innovative design for simplifying a pebble bed reactor, and the optimization of this design showed that burnup values could be increased and natural uranium uses could be reduced. The purposes of the current study were to design a simplified pebble bed reactor by removing the unloading device from the reactor system and to further optimize the burnup characteristics of this reactor with a peu à peu fuel-loading scheme by introducing thorium in the fuel configuration as a fertile material. Another goal was to optimize the fuel composition so that the system could achieve even better burnup characteristics and use scarce uranium resources more efficiently. Using a specially developed computer code, we analyzed and optimized the performance of a 110-MWt simplified pebble bed reactor using a peu à peu fuel-loading scheme. An optimized design using 30\% of fertile thorium mixed with uranium fuel with 15\% 235U enrichment and a 7\% packing fraction calculated to achieve a high burnup of 140 GWD/T for more than 21 years' operation time that could save 13 to 33\% of natural uranium use compared with the savings noted in our previous study. Neutronic, burnup and fuel economic analysis for this optimized design are discussed in this study.},

It is shown that the breather propagation is decelerated in the presence of a damping factor without the external force, while the envelope velocity and the amplitude increase significantly with the presence of external force. It is particularly found that the higher harmonic terms are enhanced when the periodic force is applied. It is finally argued that the external force accelerates the DNA breathing.},

Experiments were conducted using a modified continuous flow gas-generation system employing a soft X-ray ionizer and a particle counter, with an improved integrated online temperature, pressure and a relative humidity (RH) control system. Nucleation rates were measured as a function of SO2 concentration at different levels of RH, pressure (600–970hPa) and temperature (5–25°C). The results show that the nucleation rate dependence on SO2 concentration followed a power law, and the slope varied slightly in a range from 1 to 1.26 at different RH levels (15–60\%). A positive pressure effect was generally found and a power law was followed with varied scaling for different SO2 concentrations. The trend of an increase in nucleation rate with temperature was consistent with observations in homogenous nucleation experiments, and with the behavior predicted by classical binary nucleation theory. These experimental results will be useful to explain the contribution of ion-induced nucleation in different locations and atmospheric conditions.},

The product failures is modeled using a one-dimensional approach in which usage is a function of age. Furthermore, it is assumed that the relation between these variables is linear. The slope of the line is the usage rate. The optimal periodic maintenance time can be derived by minimizing the expected cost per unit time. We also proved that the expected cost per unit time is a concave function, and gave the global optimal solution. As a numerical example, we choose Weibull distribution with different levels of usage rates.

With no vaccine and antiviral available until nowadays, and frequent appearance of extraordinary dengue outbreaks, many governments are forced to declare national problem for dengue. At this moment, the only method available to prevent dengue disease transmission is to combat the disease-carrying mosquitoes as well as to reduce the contact between human and mosquitoes. The fast growing dengue transmission in many countries in recent years indicates that the mosquito control programs are far from successful. The use of mosquito repellent is one possible instrument which could be used as an effective mass treatment to prevent the dengue outbreak during endemic period. Here in this paper a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (S-I-R) dengue transmission model with repellent mass treatment is being applied to portions of children and adult compartments. Analysis of the basic reproductive ratio (Ro) of the model is done. It is shown, with reasonable choices of portions of treated children and adults, in combination with reduction of mosquito population, the basic reproductive ratio can be significantly reduced and occurrence of endemic can be avoided. Numerical simulations are shown for various treatment scenarios.},

	abstract = {Reservoir properties estimation aims to maximize the recovery, and least squares history matching is one of strategies to achieve this target. A model is matched on historical data until it reproduced the production history. The model can be used to simulate future reservoir production. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a method designed for non linear history matching. The success of EnKF affected by non linearity of reservoir model. If the reservoir model is highly non linear the EnKF might be unstable. This paper aims to explore the stability of EnKF under different type reservoir models. Three type reservoir models are considered: (1) line source (2) bounded constant rate no flow (3) three grid reservoir. The permeability is estimated based on the matching of observed pressure with predicted pressure (obtained from reservoir model). A simulation experiment is set up to show how EnKF iteration may be used to estimate the permeability. The simulation is set up for an experiment time T, time step Δt, and number of observations m. The prior for permeability is drawn from normal distribution. The stability of the results is presented as plots of pressure history match and permeability updating. The three grid reservoir model shows instability of EnKF method, and an iterative EnKF was proposed to improve the stability of EnKF. The proposed method is able to history match the reservoir models, and exploring the stability of a more general reservoir model is needed for the success of the method.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to build a nested generalized linear mixed model using an ordinal response variable with some covariates. There are three main jobs in this paper, i.e. parameters estimation procedure, simulation, and implementation of the model for the real data. At the part of parameters estimation procedure, concepts of threshold, nested random effect, and computational algorithm are described. The simulations data are built for 3 conditions to know the effect of different parameter values of random effect distributions. The last job is the implementation of the model for the data about poverty in 9 districts of Java Island. The districts are Kuningan, Karawang, and Majalengka chose randomly in West Java; Temanggung, Boyolali, and Cilacap from Central Java; and Blitar, Ngawi, and Jember from East Java. The covariates in this model are province, number of bad nutrition cases, number of farmer families, and number of health personnel. In this modeling, all covariates are grouped as ordinal scale. Unit observation in this research is sub-district (kecamatan) nested in district, and districts (kabupaten) are nested in province. For the result of simulation, ARB (Absolute Relative Bias) and RRMSE (Relative Root of mean square errors) scale is used. They show that prov parameters have the highest bias, but more stable RRMSE in all conditions. The simulation design needs to be improved by adding other condition, such as higher correlation between covariates. Furthermore, as the result of the model implementation for the data, only number of farmer family and number of medical personnel have significant contributions to the level of poverty in Central Java and East Java province, and only district 2 (Karawang) of province 1 (West Java) has different random effect from the others. The source of the data is PODES (Potensi Desa) 2008 from BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik).},

This gives the owners the right to enjoy the benefits of private aviations. However, FMC may have complicated business requirements that neither commercial airlines nor charter airlines faces. Here, optimization models are constructed to minimize the number of aircrafts in order to maximize the profit and to minimize the daily operating cost.

This analysis is performed in a type of Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) using cooling Helium (He). The heat from nuclear fission reactions in nuclear reactors will be distributed through the process of conduction in fuel elements. Furthermore, the heat is delivered through a process of heat convection in the fluid flow in cooling channel. Temperature changes that occur in the coolant channels cause a decrease in pressure at the top of the reactor core. The governing equations in each channel consist of mass balance, momentum balance, energy balance, mass conservation and ideal gas equation. The problem is reduced to finding flow rates in each channel such that the pressure drops at the top of the reactor core are all equal. The problem is solved numerically with the genetic algorithm method. Flow rates and temperature distribution in each channel are obtained here.},

This traveling wave is caused by the displacement of a large volume of water after the occurrence of an underwater earthquake or volcano eruptions. The speed of tsunami decreases when it reaches the sea shore along with the increase of its amplitudes. Two large tsunamis had occurred in the last decades in Indonesia with huge casualties and large damages. Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System has been installed along the west coast of Sumatra. This early warning system will give about 10-15 minutes to evacuate people from high risk regions to the safe areas. Here in this paper, a mathematical model for Tsunami evacuation is presented with the city of Padang as a study case. In the model, the safe areas are chosen from the existing and selected high rise buildings, low risk region with relatively high altitude and (proposed to be built) a flyover ring road. Each gathering points are located in the radius of approximately 1 km from the ring road. The model is formulated as an optimization problem with the total normalized evacuation time as the objective function. The constraints consist of maximum allowable evacuation time in each route, maximum capacity of each safe area, and the number of people to be evacuated. The optimization problem is solved numerically using linear programming method with Matlab. Numerical results are shown for various evacuation scenarios for the city of Padang.},

In this paper, we discuss the locating-chromatic number of Halin graph, namely a planar graph H = T ⊎ C which constructed from a plane embedding of a tree T with at least four vertices, by connecting all the leaves of T (the vertices of degree 1) to form a cycle C that passes around the tree in the natural cyclic order defined by the embedding of the tree. In particular, we investigate the locating-chromatic number of the Halin graph H = T ⊎C, where T is a subdivision of a star and a double star.},

When thermal adaptation of Klentaq1 was analyzed at the atomic level, the protein was stable at 300 and 350 K. It gradually unfolded at 373 K and almost spontaneously unfolded at 400 K. Domain separation was induced by disrupting electrostatic interactions in two salt bridges formed by Lys354-Glu445 and Asp371-Arg435 on the interface domain. The role of these interactions in protein stability was evaluated by comparing free energy solvation (ΔΔGsolv) between wild type and mutants. Substitution of Asp371 by Glu or Asn, and also Glu445 by Asn resulted in a positive value of ΔΔGsolv, suggesting that mutations destabilized the protein structure. Nevertheless, substitution of Glu445 by Asp gave a negative value to ΔΔGsolv reflecting increasing protein stability. Our results demonstrate that interactions at the interface domains of Klentaq1 are essential factors correlated with the Klentaq1 thermostability.},

However, investigation of suitable solid support in enzyme immobilization is still a scientific challenge. Polyethersulfone (PES) and aminated PES (PES–NH2) were successfully synthesized as novel materials for immobilization. Membranes with various pore sizes (from 10–600 nm) based on synthesized PES and PES–NH2 polymers were successfully fabricated to be applied as bioreactors to increase the immobilized lipase performances. The influence of pore sizes, concentration of additives, and the functional groups that are attached on the PES backbone on enzyme loading and enzyme activity was studied. The largest enzyme loading was obtained by Mucor miehei lipase immobilized onto a PES–NH2 membrane composed of 10\% of PES–NH2, 8\% of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and 5\% of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (872.62 µg/cm2). Hydrolytic activity of the immobilized lipases indicated that the activities of biocatalysts are not significantly decreased by immobilization. From the reusability test, the lipase immobilized onto PES–NH2 showed a better constancy than the lipase immobilized onto PES (the percent recovery of the activity of the lipases immobilized onto PES–NH2 and PES are 97.16\% and 95.37\%, respectively), which indicates that this novel material has the potential to be developed as a bioreactor for enzymatic reactions.},

The introduction of Zn2+ cations slightly changed the specific surface area and crystallinity of HBEA. IR, XPS and solid state MAS NMR results showed that Zn2+ cations interacted with (AlO)+ extraframework aluminum to form Zn(OAl)2 and simultaneously induced the formation of bridging hydroxyl groups, Si(OH)Al. The pyridine adsorbed IR study revealed that the presence of Zn2+ cations fully eliminated weak and partially eliminated strong Brønsted acid sites. As a result, strong and relatively weak Lewis acid sites were formed in which the pyridine probe molecule desorbed at 623K and below. The presence of Zn2+ cations enhanced the catalytic activity of HBEA in n-pentane isomerization due to the presence of strong Lewis acid sites; the sites may facilitate the formation and maintenance of active protonic acid sites through a hydrogen spillover mechanism. At 598K, the yield of isopentane for Zn-HBEA was 25.7\% higher than that of HBEA. Within a reaction temperature range of 373–648K, the apparent activation energy for isomerization of n-pentane over HBEA and Zn-HBEA was 118.76 and 90.79kJ/mol, respectively.},

	abstract = {Chlorophyll a is one the most abundant pigment on Earth that responsible for trapping the light energy to perform photosynthesis in green plants. This molecule is a metal-complex that consists of a porphyrin ring with high symmetry that acts as ligands with magnesium as the central ion. Chlorophyll a has been studied for many years from different point of views for both experimental and theoretical interests. In this study, the restricted Hartree-Fock configuration interaction single (RHF/CIS), time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and some semi-empirical methods (CNDO/s and ZINDO) calculations were carried out and compared to reconstruct the UV-Vis absorption spectra of chlorophyll a. In some extend, the calculation results based on a single molecule calculation were succeeded to reconstruct the absorption spectra but required to be scaling to match the experimental one. Different computational methods (ab initio and semi-empirical) exhibit the differences in the energy correction factor and the presence of transition states, however, still conserve the main spectral features. In general, the semi-empirical methods provide a better energy scaling factor, which means closer to the experimental one. However, they lack of fine features or vertical transitions with respect to the experimental spectra. The ab initio calculations result more complete features than the semi-empirical methods, especially the TDDFT with high level of basis sets that provides a good accuracy in transition energies. The contribution of ground states and excited states orbitals in the main vertical transitions is discussed based on orbital structure. This might gives a new perspective to explain the energy transfer phenomena in the absorption processes that related to the function of chlorophyll a as a light-harvesting antenna.},

In this study, acid-base complex membrane was synthesized based on N-succinylchitosan-chitosan complexes. The N-succinylchitosan was blended with chitosan in acetic acid at various substitution degree of N-succinylchitosan with weight ratio of N-succinylchitosan of 80\% w/w. The acid-base complex membranes were cast from the polymer solution and dried by evaporation. The properties of the membranes such as water uptake, ion exchange capacity, proton conductivity, and mechanical strength were analyzed. It was observed that the increase of substitution degree of N-succinylchitosan tends to increase the proton conductivity. The optimum performance of membrane unit is attained by the substitution degree of N-succinylchitosan of 0.72, which is reflected by its ion exchange capacity of 3.45 meq/g and proton conductivity of 7.35 × 10-2 S cm-1, respectively. Blending of N-succinylchitosan and chitosan also improved the mechanical strength of the membranes. These results imply that this type of polyelectrolyte complex membrane is a good candidate for proton exchange membrane in fuel cell applications.},

	abstract = {In this study, the effect of cationic surfactant (benzalkonium chloride) on the transport of KCl through a sulfonated styrene-divinyl benzene cation-exchange membrane was investigated. The presence of benzalkonium chloride as the cationic surfactant, which interacts with the sulfonic groups on membrane surface, has to disturb the transport of K+ ions and directly gives responses in its chronopotentiogram. The electrodialysis of the cationic surfactant solution showed an irreversible monotonous increase of the total system potential due to the fouling phenomena. However, a small amount of cationic surfactant in the membrane surface vicinity was observed to give a fluctuating chronopotentiogram at the high current density. This fluctuation is started by a steep increase and followed by the decrease of potential, which finally relaxed to reach a steady state. This potential fluctuation is proposed to be the response of a structural transformation of surfactant micelles on the membrane surface under perturbation of the externally applied electric field, which is discussed and examined qualitatively in this report.},

	abstract = {A polymer electrolyte membrane widely used in PEMFCs and DMFCs is a perfluorosulfonated membrane (the Nafion membrane). This perfluorosulfonated membrane material exhibits good chemical stability and proton conductivity, but it is very expensive and difficult to recycle. There is a high methanol crossover in DMFCs that causes a decrease in efficiency and performance of the fuel cell, so that a polymer electrolyte membrane with a low methanol crossover is needed as a substitute for the Nafion membrane. One of the materials that can be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane is the polyblends from sulfonated polystyrene-lignosulfonate (SPS-LS). Such polyblends were prepared by casting a polymer solution and characterized as polyelectrolyte membrane for DMFCs. The SPS was prepared by sulfonation of polystyrene with acetyl sulfate as the sulfonating agent. The membranes of the SPS-LS were characterized by analysis of functional groups, mechanical properties and methanol permeability. The maximum mechanical properties of the SPS-LS membrane were observed at an LS ratio of 7.5\%. However, the methanol permeability of the membrane increased with the increase of the LS ratio in the SPS-LS membranes. The properties of the membranes, especially their mechanical properties and methanol permeability, were close to that of Nafion® 117 membrane, so SPS-LS membranes have high potential for use as polymer electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cells.},

In previous research, it was assumed that the beach can absorb all of the transmitted wave energy, when an optimal dimension for a submerged parallel bar is obtained and the wave amplitude is reduced as more bars are installed. However, for a hard-wall beach there are waves reflected from the beach that change the long-term wave interaction. We adopt the linear shallow water equations in Riemann invariant form and use the method of characteristics, in a procedure applicable to various formations of submerged rectangular bars. The distance from the parallel bar (or bars) to the beach determines the phase differences between right running waves in the beach basin and whether they superpose destructively or constructively before hitting the beach, to define the safest and the most dangerous cases. Our numerical calculations for one bar, two bars and for periodic rectangular bars confirm the analytical formulae obtained.},

In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the steady state case and solve the equation analytically by means of asymptotic expansion for a particular limit of the oxygen consumption rate. Results show that there exists a critical ratio between supply and consumption of oxygen in the tissue region in order to fulfill the cell’s oxygen requirements. Above from this critical ratio, we also found a critical distance in the tissue region above which the oxygen concentration vanishes. We compared our asymptotic results with numerical simulations, which turned out to be quite in agreement.},

In this study, the process is assumed to be a one-dimensional pseudohomogeneous model and takes place with a certain reaction rate in which thewhole process ofthereactor is still workable. Thus, the reaction rate can proceed at a fixed temperature. Under these conditions, we can restrict ourselves to solving the equations for the conversion only. From the available data, it turns out that the ratio of the diffusion term to the reaction term is small. Hence, this ratio is considered as a small parameter in our model and this leads to a singular perturbation problem. Numerical difficulties will be found in the vicinity of a small parameter in front of a higher order term. Here, we present an analytical solutionby means of matched asymptotic expansions. The result shows that, up to and including the first order of approximation, the solution is in agreement with the exact and numerical solutions of the boundary value problem.},

The conventional technique employs a manual  trial-and-error  process  to  find  new  well  locations,  which  proves  to  be time-consuming, especially for large fields. Concerning this practical matter, an alternative in the form of a robust technique is introduced in order to reduce time and  effort  in  finding  new  well  locations  capable  of  producing  the  highest  oil recovery.

The maximum fitness value indicates the best grid location for a new well. In order to validate the proposed GA method and evaluate the performance of the program, two fields with different production profile characteristics were used, fields X and Y. The proposed method proved to be a robust and accurate method to find the best new well locations for oil field development.

	abstract = {Cloud computing today has now been growing as new technologies and new business models. In distributed technology perspective, cloud computing most like client-server services like web-based or web-service but it used virtual resources to execute. Currently, cloud computing relies on the use of an elastic virtual machine and the use of network for data exchange. We conduct an experimental setup to measure the quality of service received by cloud computing customers. Experimental setup done by creating a HTTP service that runs in the cloud computing infrastructure. We interest to know about the impact of increasing the number of users on the average quality received by users. The qualities received by user measured within two parameters consist of average response times and the number of requests time out. Experimental results of this study show that increasing the number of users has increased the average response time. Similarly, the number of request time out increasing with increasing number of users. It means that the qualities of service received by user are decreasing also. We found that the impact of the number of users on the quality of service is no longer in linear trend. The results of this study can be used as a reference model for the network operator in performing services in which a certain number of users in order to obtain optimal quality services.},

We study three maintenance service options considering the availability target from both the owner and OEM point of views and use a non-cooperative game formulation to determine the optimal price structure (i.e., the contract price and repair cost) for the OEM and the optimal contract option for the owner.},

In general, the innermost temperature, Tin, increases with the increase of i for a fixed value of \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\$\$ and a*, due to the Doppler effect. However, for i \&gt; 50° and \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\&gt;{\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turn\}\$\$, Tin starts to decrease with the increase of \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\$\$. This is a result of self-obscuration – the radiation from the innermost hot part of the disc is blocked by the surrounding cooler part. The value of \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turn\}\$\$ and the corresponding luminosities depend on a* and i. Such obscuration effects cause an interesting behaviour on the disc luminosity (Ldisc)–Tin plane for high inclinations. In addition to the standard disc branch which appears below \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turn\}\$\$ and which obeys \$\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm disc\} {\textbackslash}propto T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm in\}{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$\$ relation, another branch above \$\${\textbackslash}skew2{\textbackslash}dot\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turn\}\$\$, which is nearly horizontal, may be observed at luminosities close to the Eddington luminosity. We show that these features are likely observed in a Galactic X-ray source, GRS 1915+105. We support a high spin parameter (a* \&gt; 0.9) for GRS 1915+105 since otherwise the high value of Tin and small size of the emitting region (rin \&lt; 1rS) cannot be explained.},

The optimal control problem is designed with four control parameters, namely the treatment rates for children and adult compartments, and the drop-out rates from both compartments. The cost functional accounts for the total number of the infected persons, the cost of the treatment, and the cost related to reducing the drop-out rates.

This approach was achieved via minimal requirement of chemical compensation where additional fresh reactants were added into the mother liquor followed by pH adjustment after each cycle of synthesis. The solid product of each successive batch was collected and characterized while the non-reacted reagents in supernatant can be recovered and re-used to produce subsequent cycle of MCM-41. The multi-cycle synthesis is demonstrated up to three times in this research.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data confirmed the formation of ordered mesostructured silica nanoparticles. The performance of MSNs was then tested on an ibuprofen immobilization and release. The results revealed that unmodified MSN demonstrated the best immobilization rate and capacity of ibuprofen (98\%), MSNpost exhibited higher ibuprofen adsorption (78\%) as compared to MSNco (71\%), suggesting the modification method is not the dominant factor for the adsorption studied. In fact, according to the FT-IR results, the silanol groups density was found to be the contributing factor that affected the adsorption. The in vitro drug release was also investigated with simulated biological fluids. In 20h, MSNco showed the fastest release of ibuprofen (100\%), followed by MSN (50\%) and MSNpost (38\%). Both pore size and amine groups influenced the rate of the release process. From the results, MSN and MSNpost is suggested to have suitable features for slow drug release which provides constant release over a defined period to avoid repeated administration. While MSNco could be best employed as a fast release system that provides initial burst of drug release to achieve rapid and maximum relief.},

The results showed that AlPO-5 crystals with hexagonal thin-plate morphology were obtained when [edmim]Br ionic liquid was used in ionothermal treatment. The crystallinity, size and morphology of the AlPO-5 materials were also found to be strongly influenced by two major factors, chemical composition of the gel mixture and the heating time of the gel mixture.},

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the washed complexes appear sharp at 12.9°–13.2° and 19.6°–20.1°, clear signs of the presence of V6I-amylose. Other diffraction peaks correlate with V6II-amylose, which indicates that the complexed amylose helices are in the form of an intermediate or a mixture of V6I- and V6II-amylose. SEM imaging reveals that the amylose–PTHF complexes crystallize in the form of lamellae, which aggregate in a round shape on top of one another with a diameter around 4–8 μm. Some lamellas aggregate as flower-like or flat-surface spherulitic crystals. There is a visible matrix in between the aggregated lamellas which shows that a part of the amylose–PTHF complexes is amorphous.},

	abstract = {Several methods were used to investigate the possibility of preparing inclusion complexes between amylose and polytetrahydrofurans (PTHF) via direct mixing. Potato amylose (Mv ∼ 200 kg/mol) and synthetic amylose (Mn 42 kg/mol) were complexed with PTHF having different molecular weights (Mn between 650 and 2900 g/mol) to study the effect of the length of the host and the guest molecules on the complexation. The resulted products were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that showed a characteristic melting peak in the range of 120–140 °C. Emulsification of both amylose and polytetrahydrofuran improved the complexation. The largest amount of complexes was obtained with shorter PTHF chains, which also resulted in less amylose retrogradation. Furthermore, PTHF chains with similar molecular weight but different end groups were used. Amine terminated PTHF formed a higher amount of complexes compared to the hydroxyl terminated PTHF. However, no amylose complexes were formed using benzoyl terminated PTHF with low molecular weight. This is due to the bulky group of benzoyl, which indicates that the mechanism of the complexation between amylose and PTHF occurs via insertion rather than wrapping. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the included PTHFs induced the formation of the so-called V-amylose with six glucose residues per helix turn. Some additional diffraction peaks indicate that the induced V6-amylose is probably an intermediate or the mixtures between V6I- and V6II-amylose.},

XRD indicates that amylose–PTHF complexes diffract similar to amylose–fatty acids complexes (V6I-amylose helices), with additional diffractions correlating with amylose–alcohol complexes (V6II-amylose helices). This suggests that the structure of amylose–PTHF complexes is an intermediate or a mixture between V6I- and V6II-amylose.

The influences of Al concentration on the surface morphology and electrical properties of AZO layer were investigated by atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements. The experimental results indicate that Al concentration has major influence on the grain size and only minor influence on crystallite size, leading to different surface morphology for different doping concentrations. Doping at high concentration produces higher charge carrier density, but not for charge carrier mobility and its electrical conductivity, which may be also influenced by the surface morphology. The effects of Al concentration in AZO layer were also observed in the J–V (current density–voltage) and small AC impedance characteristics of the fabricated solar cells. The resistance increases with Al concentration, but the capacitance decreases. The solar cell using AZO layer with doping concentration of 0.5wt\% shows the smallest impedance and the best J–V characteristics with the highest conversion efficiency. These characteristics seem to be correlated with the properties of AZO layer and its interface with the active layer.},

However, WO3 is expensive and in short supply. It is therefore important to develop efficient materials that use smaller amounts of WO3. One strategy is to produce porous materials so that the entire area of the WO3 material can be used and activated effectively. In this study, we synthesized macroporous WO3 particles using a spray-pyrolysis method with colloidal templating. Ammonium tungsten pentahydrate (ATP) was used to produce WO3 without impurities, and polystyrene (PS) spheres were used to promote spherical macropore formation. The synthesized particles were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Several process parameters (i.e. initial precursor concentration and mass ratio between host and template) were investigated to get highly ordered porous particles with controllable porous structure and particle outer diameter. Photocatalytic analysis results showed that the amount of PS that provided the optimum photocatalytic enhancement. Our results showed that a PS/ATP mass ratio of 0.60 provided WO3 particles with a photocatalytic rate 2.5 times that of dense WO3. TEM analysis showed that highly ordered macropores were produced, enabling better penetration and interaction of molecules and light in the deepest part of the active catalyst, resulting in enhancement of the photocatalytic rate. This method will be useful for large-scale synthesis of small amounts of WO3 with high photocatalytic performance.},

However, the RE elements used in these phosphors are expensive and in short supply. It is therefore important to develop phosphors that contain smaller amounts of RE materials. One strategy is to produce nanocomposite phosphors in which a cheaper and more readily available material is used as a matrix for an RE oxide. In this study, we produced a YAG:Ce/SiO2 nanocomposite using a sol–gel method; poly(ethylene glycol) and urea were added to promote micelle formation and agglomeration, respectively. The nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopies (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We determined the concentration of SiO2 that provided maximum PL enhancement, and used geometrical models as well as the characterization results to propose an explanation for this enhancement. Our results showed that an SiO2 concentration of 10 vol\% provided a PL intensity 120\% that of pure YAG:Ce. TEM analysis showed that SiO2 nanoparticles covered the voids between the single grain boundaries of the YAG:Ce crystals, thereby inhibiting light scattering, resulting in enhanced PL. This method will be useful for large-scale synthesis of low-RE, high-PL phosphors.},

Understanding the self-assembly phenomenon allows the creation of creative materials with unique structures that may offer performance improvements in a variety of applications. However, current research on the self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles have been conducted only on uncharged droplet systems. In this report, we first investigated the self-assembly processes of charged colloidal nanoparticles in charged droplets during spray-drying. Silica nanoparticles and polystyrene spheres are used as a model system. To induce a positive or a negative charge on the droplets, we used an electrospray method. Repulsive and attractive interactions between charged colloidal nanoparticles and droplet surface are found to control the self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles inside the charged droplet. Interestingly, self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles inside charged droplets under various processing parameters (i.e., droplet charge, droplet diameter, and surface charge, size, and composition of colloidal nanoparticles) allows the formation of unique nanostructured particles, including porous and hollow particles with control over the internal structure, external shape, number of hollow cavities, and shell thickness, in which this level of control cannot be achieved using conventional spray-drying method.},

It follows that the asymptotic geometries are of a constant and nonzero scalar curvature which are generally not Einstein. These spaces could also correspond to the near horizon geometries which are the product spaces of a two anti-de Sitter surface and the two sphere if the value of the scalars in both regions coincide.

	abstract = {In this paper we present an analysis of a three-dimensional singularly perturbed conservative system. We add a constant vector in the vector field to remove one of the symmetries in the system. Using the geometric argument, and a theorem which is derived from the implicit function theorem, we prove the existence of equilibria in the system and also derive some local bifurcations of these equilibria, i.e. saddle-node bifurcations. We also show that although we have two saddle-nodes in the system, the codimension-2 bifurcation called the cusp bifurcation is not possible. More sophisticated bifurcations, such as the Hopf bifurcation and the bifurcation of the created periodic solution are derived by using the numerical continuation software MATCONT. Following the periodic solution, we found a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations which leads to the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions. The coexistence of two attractors is an interesting phenomenon which is observed in this paper. Using asymptotic analysis, we discuss the dynamics in the neighborhood of a particular line in phase space at which the competition between these attractors takes place.},

	abstract = {Thermal–hydraulic analysis of sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) test subassemblies has been performed employing subchannel analysis method. In order to improve the accuracy of the calculation, recent empirical correlations of pressure drop coefficient and inter-channel mixing for evaluation of coolant flow in wire-wrapped fuel subassemblies have been incorporated into the subchannel analysis model. To confirm the prediction capability of the model, calculations and comparisons with available experimental data of 19- and 37-pin subassemblies have been performed. A comparison with previous results of a 127-pin subassembly has also been performed. The results show that empirical correlations which consider three subchannel types separately are capable of predicting the coolant temperature distribution at bundle outlet best among models. Moreover it has been found that the agreement between calculation result and experimental data of outlet temperature distribution improves when bundle hot dimensions are employed. In addition to the conventional flow resistance models, performance of a method of directly varying coolant flow areas to model geometrical disturbance due to the presence of wire spacers has been evaluated. It has been found that the method is capable of simulating crossflows between adjacent subchannels. All the results show reasonably good agreement with the reference data, in which the root mean square (RMS) differences are within 10\% for all cases analyzed in this study.},

The accumulative fuel loading scheme has unique characteristics that make it different from Multipass or Once Through Then Out (OTTO) fuel loading schemes. In this fueling scheme, significant changes of power distributions occur in a limited area at the top of the reactor core, where new fuel pebbles are inserted during reactor operation. We analyzed three different reactor conditions: different heights of the active core at the beginning, middle, and end of life as a consequence of the accumulative fuel loading scheme. In the analysis of a depressurized loss-of-flow accident, it was assumed that no natural circulation was possible, so that heat would be transferred through conduction and radiation with the last heat sink being the ground. Our analysis obtained temperature distributions inside the reactor core for each condition. The maximum temperature achieved in our simulation was 1287°C, which is lower than the safety limit of 1600°C.},

The objective of this study is to evaluate the possibility of increasing thermal power of the IRIS reactor by 20\%, for a better economic performance. This study includes core neutronic and thermal hydraulic aspects. The power uprate is achieved by minimizing core radial power peaking, and by increasing fuel enrichment and coolant mass flow rate. Parametric calculations have been carried out to optimize the power-uprated core design, with the objective of obtaining relatively low core power peaking and similar initial reactivity with that of the reference core. The optimization is achieved by means of enrichment zoning and application of burnable poison, with different configuration from that of the reference core. The performance of power-uprated core is compared with the reference core. The calculation results show that the proposed core-uprated design with thermal power of 1200MWt shows preferable characteristics, such as low power peaking of around 1.43, negative reactivity coefficients, and relatively high MDNBR of 3.454.},

The method was used to predict the limit values of the injected oxygen into the liquid lead for maximum corrosion inhibition of iron. It is from experimental results, in order to inhibit the corrosion at possible lowest rate then a stable self-healing protective iron oxide layer should be developed at the surface of steel continuously. In this research we investigated the iron corrosion and it can be predicted that the protective oxide layer may be formed by injecting oxygen within the range of 5.35×10−2wt\% to 8.95×10−2wt\% (for observed temperature 750°C). The oxygen 5.35×10−2wt\% is the lower limit to prevent high dissolution of iron while the oxygen content of 8.95×10−2wt\% is the upper limit to avoid high precipitation of lead oxide. We also guess that effect of oxygen injection into liquid lead creates a thin oxygen barrier that separating the liquid lead and iron oxides from direct interaction. The iron oxides layer and oxygen barrier then may be regarded as double corrosion inhibition.},

In view of importance of the accurate description of the velocity profile and eddy diffusivity, in the present work the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is utilized. Our interest however, lies not in radiotracer experiment, dispersion determination and CFD simulations as separate tasks, but in their relation. This work clearly shows what physical interpretation of experimental conditions mean in view of two definitions of tracer concentration and different possible initial/boundary conditions. Similarly to selection of the mathematical model adequate to experimental conditions, the main difficulty in numerical tracer test is in finding an approach that may be accepted as adequate to the real tracer test. In fact, the CFD simulations should resemble the real tracer investigation. From two different approaches examined, the unsteady option of CFD solver and species transport model was selected as appropriate. The considerations on experiment/simulation relation apply not only to radiotracer but other tracer techniques as well.},

Recently, a concept which called as thorium molten salt nuclear energy synergetic (THORIMS-NES) was being proposed for the safe and sustainable nuclear industry. THORIMS-NES miniFUJI reactor is a small power MSR which originally considers Th/233U or Th/Pu as main fuel. In this study, the utilization of Pu and minor actinides (MA) in 25MWth and 50MWth miniFUJI reactors has been evaluated. The reactor grade plutonium and weapon grade plutonium are employed in the present study. The criticality for 25MWth of miniFUJI can be accomplished by loading 8.76\% of reactor grade Pu \& MA (RGPuMA), and 3.96\% of weapon grade Pu \& MA (WGPuMA) in fuel, respectively. While, for that of 50MWth, the reactor can attain its criticality with 9.16\% and 4.36\% of RGPuMA and WGPuMA, correspondingly. The neutron spectra become harder with the lower grade of fissile plutonium vector as well as the increasing of Pu and MA contents in loaded fuel salt.},

	abstract = {Recycling minor actinide (MA) as well as used uranium and plutonium can be considered to reduce nuclear waste production as well as to increase the intrinsic aspect of nuclear nonproliferation as doping material. Plutonium production as a significant aspect of recycling nuclear fuel option, gives some advantages and challenges, such as fissile material utilization of plutonium as well as production of some even mass number plutonium. The study intends to evaluate the material attractiveness based on the intrinsic feature of material barrier such as plutonium composition, decay heat and spontaneous fission neutron components from spent fuel (SF) light water reactor (LWR) and fast breeder reactor (FBR) cycles. A significant contribution has been shown by decay heat (DH) and spontaneous fission neutron (SFN) of even mass number of plutonium isotopes to the total DH and SFN of plutonium element, in particular from isotopic plutonium Pu-238 and Pu-240 contributions. Longer decay cooling time and higher burnup are effective to increase the material barrier (DH and SFN) level from reactor grade plutonium level to MOX grade plutonium level. Material barrier of plutonium element from spent fuel (SF) FBR in the core regions has similarity to the material barrier profile of SF LWR which can be categorized as MOX fuel grade plutonium. Plutonium compositions, DH and SFN components are categorized as weapon grade plutonium level for FBR blanket regions with no doping minor actinide (MA) case. Doping MA in the FBR blanket regions is effective to increase the material barrier level from weapon grade plutonium to MOX fuel or more grade level. Moreover, increasing material barrier of plutonium isotopes can be achieved effectively by increasing Pu-238 production as main contributor for LWR and FBR core regions, and from converted MA in the FBR blanket which affects directly to increase DH and SFN components.},

Incorporation of the advection process is the key factor for the appearance of lognormal distribution.},

	abstract = {We consider a product sold with two-dimensional warranties - such cars, trucks, etc. In the last decade, the manufacturer offers a greater age and mileage coverage in the warranty term - e.g. a car is warranted for maximum of 5 years or 10×103 miles. The greater warranty coverage results in a higher product competitiveness, but that will increase the warranty cost to the manufacturer for servicing the warranty. This will become a major interest to the manufacturer to reduce the warranty cost. An appropriate servicing strategy involving replacement or imperfect repair reduces the warranty cost significantly. A variety of such servicing strategies has been studied in the literature, but most of them deal with one dimensional warranties and the number of replacement or imperfect repair allowed at most one. For a product sold with a greater age and mileage warranty coverage, two or more imperfect repairs will be needed in order to reduce the warranty cost. In this paper, we study servicing strategies which allows more then one imperfect repairs for the case of two dimensional warranties. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the optimal solution (in term of the optimal parameter values of the servicing strategies studied and the corresponding expected warranty costs) and then compare the results with those of the servicing strategy with only one imperfect repair.},

This associated coronal holes have filament-like morphology with a thick long thread as it’s ‘spine’, defined as Deep Coronal Hole. Because of strong magnetic field of sunspot, these filaments and coronal holes emerged far from active region and lasted for several days. It is interesting as for segmented filament, deep coronal holes above the filaments lasted for a quite long period of time and merged.

We find that C/1999 X3 will plunge into the sun in only about 2100 yrs. This lifetime is roughly a quarter that of the known sun-grazer comet 96P/Machholz 1. Involving an adopted 96P model of cometary outgassing and relativity correction into the equations of motion of the comet will insignificantly shorten its lifetime, before impact. We generated about 3500 orbital clones of C/1999 X3 to analyze orbital variations of the comet. Results show that 95\% clones will impact the Sun over the lifetime. This high solar impact probability offers a study of cometary dynamics in near-Earth space for which it may indicate a new group of Sun-grazer.},

We aimed to study the behavior of long term interval of state A in GRS 1915+105. Similar to the previous studies, we used color-color diagram for our analysis after correcting for the background. We also considered the absorption effect of the interstellar medium which is dominant below 10 keV. In general, the obtained results are in good agreement with the previous studies.

The stability of such triple star systems has been of interest to many authors. In one of the studies, it is found that the instability of triple stars system is also determined by its critical period ratio (outer/inner), beside its mass ratio. In this study, they considered stars of mass 0.01 – 100 solar mass, with mass ratio range of 1 – 100. By using Mercury code, we extend their work to study the effects of initial inclination to the stability of the systems. The code validation results in an agreement with their results, i.e the bigger the period ratio of a system from its critical period ratio, the system will tend to be more stable. In this paper, we report the results of our simulations which have been performed to see how initial inclination affects the stability of a system. A grid of three initial parameters (distance, inclination, and phase) has been used to initiate the simulations. We conclude that the bigger the outer binary’s inclination, the system will be more stable.},

Simulations show that energy injection by dark matter annihilation to stars causes decreasing in temperature and pressure in the stellar core. Hence, the rate of hydrogen burning drops. Stars are able to maintain hydrogen in their core for longer period and extend their lifetime in the main sequence.

On the other hand, these merger products still have to face dissolving processes triggered by both internal and external factors. In this study, we performed N-body simulations of merger binary clusters with different initial conditions. After merging, these clusters dissolve with greater mass-loss rate because of their angular momentum. These rotating clusters also experience more deceleration caused by external tidal field.},

	abstract = {Gravitational lens time delay method has been used to estimate the rate of cosmological expansion, called the Hubble constant, H0, independently of the standard candle method. This gravitational lensing method requires a good knowledge of the lens mass distribution, reconstructed using the lens image properties. The observed positions of the images, and the redshifts of the lens and the images serve as strong constraints to the lens equations, which are then solved as a set of simultaneous linear equations. Here we made use of a non-parametric technique to reconstruct the lens mass distribution, which is manifested in a linear equations solver named PixeLens. Input for the calculation is chosen based on prior known parameters obtained from analyzed result of the lens case observations, including time-delay, position angles of the images and the lens, and their redshifts. In this project, 18 fairly well studied lens cases are further grouped according to a number of common properties to examine how each property affects the character of the data, and therefore affects the calculation of H0. The considered lens case properties are lens morphology, number of image, completeness of time delays, and symmetry of lens mass distribution. Analysis of simulation shows that paucity of constraints on mass distribution of a lens yields wide range value of H0, which reflects the uniqueness of each lens system. Nonetheless, gravitational lens method still yields H0 within an acceptable range of value when compared to those determined by many other methods. Grouping the cases in the above manner allowed us to assess the robustness of PixeLens and thereby use it selectively. In addition, we use glafic, a parametric mass reconstruction solver, to refine the mass distribution of one lens case, as a comparison.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, reconstruction of porous rock as well as its modelling has been developed vastly, which has been possible because of the μCT scanning devices. One of a famous rock that has been a subject of many researches in the characterization of porous medium is the Fontainebleau sandstone. Its homogeneity of the pore structure has been one of the reasons of the development of computational analyses that have also been applied to characterize the rock. The characteristics include porosity, permeability, curvature, pore connectivity, and percolation. Many models have also been developed based on the properties of this rock, e.g., the Gaussian Field model, Diagenesis model, Simulated Annealing model and Continuum Geometrical model. In this paper we are interested in the characteristic of the pore geometry of Fontainebleau and its models, i.e., the quantification of pore shape. We performed analysis based on Fourier Descriptor, which utilized Complex Fourier analysis where the boundary of the 2D pore is circumnavigated in the complex plane, such as to obtain the shape boundary coordinates of an object. The analysis using Fourier Descriptors demonstrates that the complexity level can be distinguished using the extracted length characteristic of the shape signature, i.e., the higher the level of complexity, the higher the length characteristic of shape signature. From this analysis we conclude that the Continuum Geometrical model has the most similar pore geometry characteristics with the Fontainebleau sandstone.},

In experiment, three kinds of pipe inner diameter d (4, 6, and 8 mm) have been used to find its influence to the flow occurrence. The U-shape self-siphon has three different segments, where length of the first segment plays important role for the flow occurrence. The segment has length L + h, which stands for length above and below water surface in water container, respectively. In simulation, head (interface between water and air in the siphon) equation of motion is solved numerically using Euler method. Working spaces of L against h for several d have been produced from simulation and experiment, and they show a good agreement to each other. It can be observed that the relation between L and minimum h for flow to occur becomes more linear for larger inner diameter d.},

It consisted of a vertical deformation sensor, a signal conditioner, an analog to digital converter (ADC), a microcontroller, and a display. The vertical deformation sensor was made from a rotary potentiometer. The deformation was converted to an analog voltage output by the rotary potentiometer. A signal conditioner was required to make the analog voltage output ready for being used by the ADC. The ADC then converts the analog voltage output into digital one. The digital data was later processed by the microcontroller and finally readout by the display. The resolution of the developed system was about 0.038 mm. The calibration was done by comparing the vertical deformations obtained from the potentiometer with those measured by a micrometer. It was found that the developed system can measure a maximum vertical deformation of about 40 mm.},

Characterization was then also possible to conduct using computational approach. Hydrocarbon bearing sandstone has become one of interesting objects to analyze in the last decade. In this research, we performed digital characterization of hydrocarbon bearing sandstone reservoir from Sumatra. The sample was digitized using a μCT scanner (Skyscan 1173) which produced series of reconstructed images with the spatial resolution of 15 μm. Using computational approaches, i.e., image processing, image analysis, and simulation of fluid flow inside the rock using Lattice Boltzmann Method, we have been able to obtain the porosity of the sandstone, which is 23.89\%, and the permeability, which is 9382 mD. Based on visual inspection, the porosity value, along with the calculated specific surface area, we produce a preliminary computer model of the rock using grain based method. This method employs a reconstruction of grains using the non-spherical model, and a purely random deposition of the grains in a virtual three dimensional cube with the size of 300 × 300 × 300. The model has porosity of 23.96\%, and the permeability is 7215 mD. While the error of the porosity is very small (which is only 0.3\%), the permeability has error of around 23\% from the real sample which is considered very significant. This suggests that the modeling based on porosity and specific surface area is not satisfactory to produce a representative model. However, this work has been a good example of how characterization and modeling of porous rock can be conducted using a non-destructive computational approach.},

	abstract = {In most geothermal reservoirs, cracks are considered very important because of the ability to transport water vapor. In most cases, characterizations of cracks are often difficult to be performed. However, through the vast development of imaging technique, many researches have been conducted in order to obtain better understanding regarding the nature of cracks. Using micro-CT (μCT) scanning devices, i.e., the Skyscan 1173, we were able to obtain 3D images of geothermal reservoir rock from West Java. The rock sample was scanned using X-ray voltage of 130 kV and current of 61 μA. The reconstructed images have spatial resolution of 59.85 μm/pixel. Using CTVox and ImageViewer, we were able to visualize the cracks both in 2D and 3D perspective. We further performed image processing and analysis, i.e.: simple segmentation of pore-solid by thresholding the gray values and binarizing the images, de-noising (despeckling), and 3D structure analysis. From these analyses, we obtain the value of porosity of 6.27\%, and from further analysis, we separate the crack from the granular pore. The fraction of the cracks is 2.35\% from the total volume of the sample. This preliminary study however, still contains some errors. By visualizing the produced image from the isolation, we can still observed the existence of isolated granular pores. Nonetheless, this study has confirmed that using image processing and image analysis approach of reconstructed μCT images, we were able to isolate cracks from granular pores, and also calculate the volume fraction of the cracks.},

Simulations are conducted for initial amplitude of 2 m with four types of slope: steep, moderately steep, mild, and linear slope. The initial depth decreases from 10 m to ∼6.14 m which make solitary wave split into two solitons. Simulations show that the solitary wave splits into two solitons for steep, moderately steep, and mild bottom slope, where as for linear slope the initial solitary wave will evolve into a solitary wave with a tail. From the simulation over a moderately steep bottom, amplitudes of the separated soliton admit a nearly quadratic ratio which is comparable with those resulting from the inverse scattering theory.},

	abstract = {Intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) has become a promising technology in increasing solar cell efficiency. In this work we compare absorption coefficient profile between InAs quantum dots with GaAs bulk. We calculate the efficiency of GaAs bulk and GaAs doped with 2, 5, and 10 nm InAs quantum dot. Effective distances in quantum dot arrangement based on electron tunneling consideration were also calculated. We presented a simple calculation method with low computing power demand. Results showed that arrangement of quantum dot InAs in GaAs can increase solar cell efficiency from 23.9 \% initially up to 60.4\%. The effective distance between two quantum dots was found 2 nm in order to give adequate distance to prevent electron tunneling and wave functions overlap.},

This can be happened due to spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry. Moreover, the edge current flows through their edge or surface depends on its spin orientation and also it is robust against non-magnetic impurities. Therefore, topological insulators are predicted to be useful ranging from spintronics to quantum computation. Graphene was first predicted to be the precursor of topological insulator by Kane-Mele. They developed a Hamiltonian model to describe the gap opening in graphene. In this work, we investigate the band structure of few-layer graphene by using this model with analytical approach. The results of our calculations show that the gap opening occurs at K and K’ point, not only in single layer, but also in bilayer and trilayer graphene.},

In order to be applied as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), membrane polymer should have a good ionic conductivity, high proton conductivity, and high mechanical strength. Lignosulfonate (LS) is a complex biopolymer which has crosslinks and sulfonate groups. SPS-LS blends with addition of SiO2 are used to increase the proton conductivity and to improve the mechanical properties and thermal stability. However, the biodegradation test of SPS-LS blends is required to determine whether the application of these membranes to be applied as an environmentally friendly membrane. In this study, had been done the synthesis of SPS, biodegradability test of SPS-LS blends with variations of LS and SiO2 compositions. The biodegradation test was carried out in solid medium of Luria Bertani (LB) with an activated sludge used as a source of microorganism at incubation temperature of 37°C. Based on the results obtained indicated that SPS-LS-SiO2 blends are more decomposed by microorganism than SPS-LS blends. This result is supported by analysis of weight reduction percentage, functional groups with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, and morphological surface with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).},

The lilac color of the complex represent the diamagnetic low spin state while the colorless correspond to the paramagnetic high spin state of iron(II). The transition between the two states could be tuned by changing the anionic group. Generally, the complex was synthesized directly from aqueous solution of iron(II) salt with considerable amounts of NH2-trz solution produced solid powder compound. For application as an electronic molecular device, the complex should be obtained as a thin film. The transparent [Fe(NH2trz)3]-Nafion film has been successfully obtained, however, no anion variation can be produced since the nafion is an anionic resin. In this work, the [Fe(NH2trz)3]-complexes with several anions have been synthesized inside nata de coco membrane that commonly used as a medium for deposition metal nano-particles. After drying the membrane containing the complex became a thin film. At room temperature, the film containing iron(II) complexes of sulphate and nitrate salts show lilac color, similar to that of the original complexes in the powder form. On heating, the color of the complex film changed to colorless and this color change was observed reversibly. In contrast, the films containing perchlorate and tetrafluoroborate iron(II) complexes are colorless at room temperature and changed to lilac on cooling. The significant color changing of the iron(II)complexes in the nata de coco film can be used for demonstration thermo chromic effect of smart materials with relatively small amount of the compounds.},

Markov chain analysis results on data of mutations that occur in mitochondrial DNA indicate that one and two positions after the position of mutated nucleotide bases tend to be occupied by particular nucleotide bases. From this analysis, it can be said that the adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine will mutate if the nucelotide base at one and/or two positions after them is cytosine.},

The discovery of new anti-tubercular drugs is needed to face the increasing TB cases, especially to prevent the increase of cases with resistant Mtb. A potential novel drug target is the Mtb PhoR sensor domain protein which is the histidine kinase extracellular domain for receiving environmental signals. This protein is the initial part of the two-component system PhoR-PhoP regulating 114 genes related to the virulence of Mtb. In this study, the gene encoding PhoR sensor domain (SensPhoR) was subcloned from pGEM-T SensPhoR from the previous study (Suwanto, 2012) to pColdII. The construct pColdII SensPhoR was confirmed through restriction analysis and sequencing. Using the construct, SensPhoR was overexpressed at 15°C using Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Low temperature was chosen because according to the solubility prediction program of recombinant proteins from The University of Oklahama, the PhoR sensor domain has a chance of 79.8\% to be expressed as insoluble proteins in Escherichia coli's (E. coli) cytoplasm. This prediction is also supported by other similar programs: PROSO and PROSO II. The SDS PAGE result indicated that the PhoR sensor domain recombinant protein was overexpressed. For future studies, this protein will be purified and used for structure analysis which can be used to find potential drugs through rational drug design.},

This species is traditionally used by Indonesian people to cure digestive disorders, fever, or headache. Jayanti can grow well in tropical to subtropical region, such as in Asia and Africa. Based on literature, qualitative analysis of the methanol extract of leaves of S. sesban showed that it contained flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins and glycosides. In addition, the activity assay of extracts of different tissues of this species showed antitumor, antimalarial, and antidiabetic activityies (leaves and seed extracts), antioxidants (flower extract), and analgesic (wood extract). Though the extracts of S. sesban parts showed interesting activities, chemical study of those extracts have not been widely reported. Therefore, the objective of this research was to isolate the secondary metabolites from methanol extract of leaves of S. sesban and to determine their cytotoxicity against murine leukemia P-388 cells. One compound has been obtained and identified as 3-hydroxy-4',7-dimethoxyflavone (1), a new isolated compound from nature. This compound was obtained through separation of methanol extract using various chromatographic techniques, such as vacuum liquid chromatography and radial chromatography. The structure elucidation of isolated compound was based on 1D NMR (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR) and 2D NMR (HMBC). The cytotoxicity of methanol extract and compound 1 against murine leukemia P-388 cells examined through MTT assay showed IC50 value of 60.04 μg/mL and 5.40 μg/mL, respectively.},

We utilize an In-Vitro μCT scanner Skyscan 1173 to acquire a three dimensional image data of a chicken bone thigh. The thigh was scanned using X-ray voltage of 45 kV and current of 150 μA. The reconstructed images have spatial resolution of 142.50 μm/pixel. Using image processing and analysis e.i segmentation by thresholding the gray values (which represent the pseudo density) and binarizing the images, we were able to visualize each part of the bone, i.e., the cortical and trabecular regions. Total volume of the bone is 4663.63 mm3, and the surface area of the bone is 7913.42 mm2. The volume of the cortical is approximately 1988.62 mm3 which is nearly 42.64\% of the total bone volume. This pilot study has confirmed that the μCT is capable of quantifying 3D bone structural properties and defining its regions separately. For further development, these results can be improved for understanding the pathophysiology of bone abnormality, testing the efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention, or estimating bone biomechanical properties.},

The hydrocephalus condition which is shown by the significant value of ventricle displacement, as the result shows, is occurred when the aqueduct is as resistant as brain parenchyma for the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.

Many uncertainties exist in recovery estimation due to reservoir rock properties such as permeability and porosity. The estimate of such parameters may change with the available observations and time. This paper reports the use of Bayesian ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to estimate the permeability. It is a method in which a sample of state are generated and updated sequentially. Two simulated experiments are presented to investigate the applicability of EnKF. The first concern is using EnKF for parameter estimation in reservoir models such as line source, bounded reservoir, 1D flow numerical model. The second concern is using EnKF in one dimensional two interacting wells. The solutions are derived analytically. The state consists of the parameters and the analytical solution. The estimation process consists of two steps: forecast and update. Forecast step is calculated by using forward function which can be analytical or numerical solution. Update step uses Kalman filter scheme where the gain is calculated from sample covariance. Asymptotic studies as the basis for the validity of EnKF is well established and summarized in this report. The study concludes that EnKF can provide satisfactory results for reservoir reserve parameter estimation. Parameter estimation for reservoir simulation is an important future issue in order to improve the forecast.},

The four hydrogen atoms in CH4 are permuted by the action of the symmetry group and this action fixes the carbon atom. At each of the 5 vertices, we assign three unit vectors, called the standard basis vectors in directions of the three edges which are joined to the vertex. The symmetry group G of the molecules permutes the 15 standard basis vectors, so we may regard ℚ15 as a 𝔾G By expressing ℚ15 as a direct sum of irreducible 𝔾G-modules, the problem of finding the normal modes of vibration is reduced to that of computing the eigenvectors of some small matrices.},

Another characteristic in a DHF patient is hypoalbuminea (decreasing of albumin concentration). Plasma leakage can be modelled by constructing mathematical model of albumin concentration in plasma blood due to increasing of cytokine. In this paper, decreasing of albumin concentration in blood plasma is modelled using diffusion equation. In addition, two-dimensional numerical simulations of albumin concentration are also presented. From the simulation, it is found that the greater leakage rate or the wider leakage area, the greater decreasing albumin concentration will be. Furthermore, when time t increases, the albumin concentration decreases to zero.},

We construct a simulation for measuring the robustness of the flight schedule, where the probability of crew pairing found after a number of flight delays happen is used as the measure of robustness.

In this paper, we will find a relation between reflected wave and incoming wave on a sloping beach. This result is important for later use in water wave simulations with moving boundaries. In this paper, we solve the 1-D nonlinear shallow water equation, using the conservative finite volume method. The scheme plus wet and dry procedure can simulate wave running up and down on a sloping beach. Comparison with Carrier and Greenspan analytical run up and down waves shows a good agreement. Then, we use this scheme to find a relation between reflected and incident wave on a sloping beach, incorporating the moving shoreline. And we obtain amplitude ratio and phase difference depending on wave frequency for moderate bottom slopes.},

Additionally CLV can be able to segment customers for financial arrangements. Stochastic models for the fairly new CLV used a Markov chain. In this model customer retention probability and new customer acquisition probability play an important role. This model is originally introduced by Pfeifer and Carraway in 2000 [1]. They introduced several CLV models, one of them only involves customer and former customer. In this paper we expand the model by adding the assumption of the transition from former customer to customer. In the proposed model, the CLV value is higher than the CLV value obtained by Pfeifer and Caraway model. But our model still requires a longer convergence time.},

Further, we would like to use this scheme and utilizing energy spectra of the recorded signal to extract resonant periods of arbitrary basins.

There has been a hypothesis explaining this phenomenon of which investigated the influence of parasites pathogenesis to the competition between these two mosquito species in the fields. Ascogregarina taiwanensis and Ascogregarina culicis are known as parasites that infect Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti, respectively. Several studies have concluded that Ascogregarina taiwanensis caused high fatality for Aedes aegypti larvae, but Ascogregarina culicis was not pathogenic to Aedes albopictus larvae. Therefore, Ascogregarina taiwanensis may contribute to reduce the number of populations Aedes aegypti in the fields. Inspired by these facts, a mathematical model depicting interaction between parasites and mosquitoes is constructed in this paper. In this model are included six dynamic mosquito compartments, i.e. egg, larvae, infected larvae, adult, infected adult and one dynamic compartment for parasite. Derivation of the existence criteria and the stability analysis of parasite-free equilibrium as well as the basic offspring for the model are presented.

Transmission of diarrhea disease can be reduced by controlling clean water supply and treating diarrhea patients properly. These treatments require significant amount of budget, which may not be fulfilled in the fields. In his paper, transmission of diarrhea disease in evacuation zone using SIRS model is presented as control optimum problem with clean water supply and rate of treated patients as input controls. Existence and stability of equilibrium points and sensitivity analysis are investigated analytically for constant input controls. Optimum clean water supply and rate of treatment are found using optimum control technique. Optimal results for transmission of diarrhea and the corresponding controls during the period of observation are simulated numerically. The optimum result shows that transmission of diarrhea disease can be controlled with proper combination of water supply and rate of treatment within allowable budget.},

Refraction is a bending wave phenomenon that leads the wave crest arriving at beach directed parallel to the shoreline. Shoaling is a phenomenon of increasing wave height with decreasing water depth. Shoaling and refraction are both direct consequence of energy conservation. In this paper we solve the 2D shallow water equations using the conservative finite volume method. This scheme is non dissipative, therefore it can produce shoaling coefficient correctly. Simulation of 2D plane wave above a parallel bottom contours shows that numerical wave refraction confirms the analytical wave refraction. In this way we are convinced that our scheme can produce shoaling and refraction correctly. When a wave travels over a continental shelf and further to the beach, before breaking, the wave will experience shoaling and refraction which is not homogeneous along the beach. Numerical simulation shows that a bottom sill may induce wave focusing. This wave focusing governed by offshore topography may explain the striking differences from the adjacent coastal damage.},

We obtain a definite positive IAcM whose size is twice the IAcM’s size of GSTAR(1;λ1). We acquire the GSTAR(2;λ1,λ2) process is stationary if all determinants of the IAcM’s leading principal submatrices are positive.

Bubble point is the first point at which the gas is formed when a liquid is heated. Meanwhile, dew point is the first point where the liquid is formed when the gas is cooled.

	abstract = {Fuzzy Logic in decision-making process has been widely implemented in various problems in industries. It is the theory of imprecision and uncertainty that was not based on probability theory. Fuzzy Logic adds values of degree between absolute true and absolute false. It starts with and builds on a set of human language rules supplied by the user. The fuzzy systems convert these rules to their mathematical equivalents. This could simplify the job of the system designer and the computer, and results in much more accurate representations of the way systems behave in the real world. In this paper we examine the decision making process of stock and option trading by the usage of MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) technical analysis and Option Pricing with Fuzzy Logic approach. MACD technical analysis is for the prediction of the trends of underlying stock prices, such as bearish (going downward), bullish (going upward), and sideways. By using Fuzzy C-Means technique and Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System, we define the decision output where the value of MACD is high then decision is “Strong Sell”, and the value of MACD is Low then the decision is “Strong Buy”. We also implement the fuzzification of the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula. The stock and options methods are implemented on a portfolio of one stock and its options. Even though the values of input data, such as interest rates, stock price and its volatility, cannot be obtain accurately, these fuzzy methods can give a belief degree of the calculated the Black-Scholes formula so we can make the decision on option trading. The results show the good capability of the methods in the prediction of stock price trends. The performance of the simulated portfolio for a particular period of time also shows good return.},

It is necessary to determine the possible locations and specifications of insulator and pipeline. A mathematical model is formulated by considering the oil temperature and its flow velocity. Assuming that the density variation is small, the fluid behaves as an incompressible fluid. Furthermore, numerical solutions with finite difference methods are presented with some hypothetical data to give an overview of how the system works. Two surrounding conditions are taken into account, i.e. with and without sea current. From the simulation, the location of wax formation can be predicted. At a certain depth region of sea, where the sea current is present, a greater heat loss take place in which wax may be formed immediately.

Promotion of healthy life is accounted in the model as an optimal control problem to reduce the number of smokers. In this work, the transition rates from smokers to non-smokers and from non-smokers to smokers are regarded as the control variables. Assuming the control variables are constant, equilibrium points of the model can be obtained analytically. The basic reproductive ratio as the endemic threshold is taken from the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix. Using numerical simulation, we show that the healthy life promotion can reduce the number of infected person significantly by reducing the number of smokers. Furthermore, different initial conditions to show different situations in the field are also simulated. It is shown that a large effort to increase the transition rate from smokers to non-smokers and to reduce the transition from non-smokers to smokers should be applied in the endemic reduction scenario.},

Numerical simulation shows the dynamic of each infection compartments which gives a description of within-host dynamic of dengue virus. These results show particularly that infected compartments tend to be vanished in ±15days after the onset of the virus.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics has been widely used to numerically solve equation of motion of classical many-particle system. It can be used to simulate many systems including biophysics, whose complexity level is determined by the involved elements. Based on this method, a numerical model had been constructed to mimic the behaviour of malaria-infected red blood cells within capillary vessel. The model was governed by three forces namely Coulomb force, normal force, and Stokes force. By utilizing two dimensional four-cells scheme, theoretical observation was carried out to test its capability. Although the parameters were chosen deliberately, all of the quantities were given arbitrary value. Despite this fact, the results were quite satisfactory. Combined with the previous results, it can be said that the proposed model were sufficient enough to mimic the malaria-infected red blood cells motion within obstructed capillary vessel.},

Live feed, for example feeding Artemia nauplii into angelfish larvae (Pteraphylum Scalare), is generally considered as the most suitable food for first feeding larvae. In practice, the fish farmer could replace the life feed with a formulated feed, which is sold commercially in the store. By experiments conducted by Herath et al (2013), the effect of sudden weaning of angelfish from Artemia sp. to formulated feed is observed with the change in weight of fish during the observation periods. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model describing the growth in weight of fish during this sudden weaning process using logistic model based on data from Herath et al (2013). The resulted model is solved numerically. Furthermore using this model, we consider the production cost of live feed in order to determine the optimal time to wean angelfish larvae.},

It is also believed that low adult survival rates and specialization on rare and fragmented type of habitat are the main cause leading to the endangered status of the lizard. A mathematical model with age structure for Eulamprus leuraensis, taking into account the variation of survival rate in each structure and the declining of offspring quality with respect to maternal age is considered here. Stable coexistence of non-trivial equilibriumis shown. It is also shown that an endangered status is due to combination oflow reproductive output and low rates of adult survival.

In this paper, binary and continuous genetic algorithms were implemented to estimate growth rate and carrying capacity parameter from poultry data cited from literature. For simplicity, all genetic algorithm parameters (selection rate and mutation rate) are set to be constant along implementation of the algorithm.

ESOs are an important part of company compensation and the valuation of these options has become a focus attention in finance and accounting. ESOs have special characteristics, such as: they are not tradable; they can be exercised only after the vesting period; if employees leave the company during the vesting period then the ESOs are forfeited. So valuing these options using Black-Scholes framework is less appropriate. This paper extends the model proposed by Brisley and Anderson to account for the restricted set of possible exercise dates (Bermudan style) and the state-dependent employee exit rate. We analyze the optimal early exercise decision by risk neutral valuation model. Then the price of ESOs is computed using Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method is flexible and easy to implement and modify. We also analyze ESOs properties and sensitivity with respect to the model parameters.},

Moreover, STEM allows the observation in 2D of wet samples in an ESEM by finely controlling the sample temperature and the water pressure of the sample environment. It has been recently demonstrated that it was possible to acquire image series of hydrated objects and thus to attain 3D characterization of wet samples.

	abstract = {Fe3O4/Zeolite nanocomposites have been synthesized via microwave assisted coprecipitation method and show to be efficient in reducing viscosity of heavy oil compared to other Fe3O4/Zeolite nanocomposites prepared by conventional method. The following precursors such as FeCl3⋅6H2O, FeSO4⋅7H2O, NH4OH, and natural zeolite of heulandite type were used in the sample preparation. In this study, the effect of Fe3O4 composition in the composite and microwave time heating were investigated. Fe3O4/Zeolite nanocomposites were then characterized to study the influence on crystal structures, morphology and physicochemical properties. The characterization techniques include X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen physisorption. The results show that by increasing the microwave heating time, the degree of nanocomposite intergrowth can be enhanced. The nanocomposite was tested in catalytic aquathermolysis of heavy oil at 200°C for 6 h and the Fe3O4/zeolite of 1 to 4 ratios performed the highest viscosity reduction of heavy oil reaching 92\%.},

C-dots were prepared directly by a simple hydrothermal method using citric acid as a carbon source. The C-dots solutions were mixed with a transparent epoxy resin to form C-dot epoxy composite. Furthermore, the composite precursor was deposited on the glass substrate using a spin coating method in order to fabricate C-dot epoxy composite thin film. The transmittance intensity of C-dot composite film reached up to 90\% in the visible light spectra. Using Swanopoel method, the film thickness of fabricated C-dot composite film was determined at about 1.45 μm, a value lies in a typical range needed for a wide range application. Thus, the C-dot composite film is promising in broadening applications in various fields such as energy conversion, optoelectronics, and display technology.},

XRD and optical microscopy analysis shows that Al2O3 film is growth uniformly on Si substrate and forming the γ phase of Al2O3. Raman and FTIR spectra confirm the formation of graphene like carbon layer on Al2O3. Additionally, thermal annealing for some sample series have been performed to study their structural stability.

The bistable nature of the response results from the interplay between the quantum dot's optical nonlinearity and its self-action (feedback) originating from the presence of the metal nanoparticle. The feedback is governed by a complex valued coupling parameter G = GR + iGI. We calculate the bistability phase diagram within the system's parameter space: spanned by GR, GI, and Δ, the latter being the detuning between the driving frequency and the transition frequency of the quantum dot. Additionally, switching times from the lower stable branch to the upper one (and vice versa) are calculated as a function of the intensity of the driving field. The conditions for bistability to occur can be realized, for example, for a heterodimer comprised of a closely spaced CdSe (or CdSe/ZnSe) quantum dot and a gold nanosphere.},

An anisotropic magnetization process is observed at lower temperatures, and the saturated magnetization values along the three high-symmetry directions are consistent with a local 〈111〉 Ising anisotropy with a magnetic moment gJJ = µeff = 2.5µB.},

Three transition temperatures are observed and can be linked to charge-orbital (TCO/OO∼320 K), two-dimensional-antiferromagnetic (2D-AFM) (∼200 K), and three-dimensional AFM (TN∼125 K) orderings. Below TCO/OO, σ1 shows a charge-ordering peak (∼0.8 eV) with a significant blue shift as the temperature decreases. Calculations based on a model that incorporates a static Jahn-Teller distortion and assumes the existence of a local charge imbalance between two different sublattices support this assignment and explain the blue shift. This view is further supported by the partial spectral weight analysis showing the onset of optical anisotropy at TCO/OO in the charge-ordering region (0.5–2.5 eV). Interestingly, in the charge-transfer region (2.5–4 eV), the spectral weight shows anomalies around the T2D−AFM that we attribute to the role of oxygen-p orbitals in stabilizing the CE-type magnetic ordering.

Yet, the difference in energy between the d3z2−r2 and dx2−y2 states is observed to increase when a charge-orbital ordering is established, hence revealing that the Mn 3d electronic hopping is frustrated when the MnO6 cluster orthorhombic strain is increased.

At the V L3 edge, we are able to resolve the full spectrum of orbital excitations up to 5 eV. In order to unravel the effect of superexchange interactions and the crystal field on the orbital excitations, we analyzed the energy and temperature dependence of the intra-t2g excitations at 0.1–0.2 eV in detail. While these results suggest a dominant influence of the crystal field, peak shifts of about 13–20 meV observed as a function of the transferred momentum q∥a reflect a finite dispersion of the orbital excitations. This is puzzling since theoretical models based on superexchange interactions predict a dispersion only for q∥c. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RIXS at the O K edge is very sensitive to intersite excitations. At the O K edge, we observe excitations across the Mott-Hubbard gap and an additional feature at 0.4 eV, which we attribute to two-orbiton scattering, i.e., an exchange of orbitals between adjacent sites. Altogether, our results indicate that both superexchange interactions and the crystal field are important for a quantitative understanding of the orbital excitations in YVO3.},

	abstract = {Study of digital rock physics has been through great advancement since the development of X-Ray μCT (micro computed tomography) scanning devices. One of the advantages is that the pore structure of rock can be mapped down to micro-meter scale in 3D. However, to provide better details of the pore structure with the help of high resolution (low spatial resolution per pixel/pixel resolution), such imaging technique produces large size of dataset (in order of Gigabytes). Higher spatial resolution per pixel (lower resolution) will produce smaller size of dataset (in order of hundreds of Megabytes), however, this will risk in losing significant details. This paper describes the effect of spatial resolution both from natural (instrument) resolution and from undersampling of the reconstructed image. From the analysis, we can conclude that lower natural resolution significantly decreases the quality of the produced image, thus exhibit significant risk of losing important details. In contrast to that, lower resolution image obtained from undersampling the reconstructed image do not demonstrate such significant effect to the porosity and specific surface area of the samples. This study is important for prediction of physical properties on wider range of resolution by observing the trend over several resolutions.},

The synchronization of vibrational motions of two diatomic molecules was observed in the gas system when the system temperature was controlled by thermostat. In the case of solution system, the synchronization of two molecules was found to depend on the density of solvent particles.

Minor actinide (MA) loading option which consists of neptunium, americium and curium will gives some additional contribution from converted MA into plutonium such as conversion Np-237 into Pu-238 and it's produced Pu-238 converts to Pu-239 via neutron capture. Increasing composition of Pu-238 can be used to produce fissile material of Pu-239 as additional contribution. Trans-uranium (TRU) fuel (Mixed fuel loading of MOX (U-Pu) and MA composition) and mixed oxide (MOX) fuel compositions are analyzed for comparative analysis in order to show the effect of MA to the plutonium productions in core in term of reactor criticality condition and fuel breeding capability. In the present study, neptunium (Np) nuclide is used as a representative of MAin trans-uranium (TRU) fuel composition as Np-MOX fuel type. It was loaded into the core region gives significant contribution to reduce the excess reactivity in comparing to mixed oxide (MOX) fuel and in the same time it contributes to increase nuclear fuel breeding capability of the reactor. Neptunium fuel loding scheme in FBR core region gives significant production of Pu-238 as fertile material to absorp neutrons for reducing excess reactivity and additional contribution for fuel breeding.},

This excess reactivity value is smaller than standard reactivity of conventional BWR. The use of hexagonal geometry on the fuel cell of BWR provides a substantial effect on the criticality of the reactor to obtain a longer operating time. Supported by a tight concept lattice where the volume fraction of the fuel is greater than the moderator and fuel, Thorium Nitride give good results for fuel cell design on small long life BWR. The excess reactivity of the reactor can be reduced with the addition of gadolinium as burnable poisons. Therefore the hexagonal tight lattice fuel cell design of small long life BWR that has a criticality more than 20 years of operating time has been obtained.},

Burnup step is performed based on a day step analysis which is varied from 10 days up to 800 days and for cycle operation from 1 cycle up to 8 cycles reactor operations. In addition, calculation efficiency based on the variation of computer processors to runthe analysis in term of time (time efficiency in the calculation) have been also investigated. Optimization method for reactor design analysis which is used a large fast breeder reactor typeas a reference case was performed by adopting an established reactor design code of JOINT-FR. The results show a criticality condition becomes higher for smaller burnup step (day) and for breeding ratio becomes less for smaller burnup step (day). Some nuclides contribute to make better criticality when smaller burnup step due to individul nuclide half-live. Calculation time for different burnup step shows a correlation with the time consuming requirement for more details step calculation, although the consuming time is not directly equivalent with the how many time the burnup time step is divided.},

This work proposes another calculation approach in which the nucleus is treated as a toy model. Hence, the fission process does not represent real fission process in nature completely. The toy model is formed by Gaussian distribution of random number that randomizes distance likesthe distance between particle and central point. The scission process is started by smashing compound nucleus central point into two parts that are left central and right central points. These three points have different Gaussian distribution parameters such as mean (μCN, μL, μR), and standard deviation (σCN, σL, σR). By overlaying of three distributions, the number of particles (NL, NR) that are trapped by central points can be obtained. This process is iterated until (NL, NR) become constant numbers. Smashing process is repeated by changing σL and σR, randomly.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Non-ionizing radiation therapy for cancer using pulsed electric field with high intensity field has become an interesting field new research topic. A new method using nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) offers a novel means to treat cancer. Not like the conventional electroporation, nsPEFs able to create nanopores in all membranes of the cell, including membrane in cell organelles, like mitochondria and nucleus. NsPEFs will promote cell death in several cell types, including cancer cell by apoptosis mechanism. NsPEFs will use pulse with intensity of electric field higher than conventional electroporation, between 20–100 kV/cm and with shorter duration of pulse than conventional electroporation. NsPEFs requires a generator to produce high voltage pulse and to achieve high intensity electric field with proper pulse width. However, manufacturing cost for creating generator that generates a high voltage with short duration for nsPEFs purposes is highly expensive. Hence, the aim of this research is to obtain the low cost generator design that is able to produce a high voltage pulse with nanosecond width and will be used for nsPEFs purposes. Method: Cockcroft-Walton multiplier circuit will boost the input of 220 volt AC into high voltage DC around 1500 volt and it will be combined by a series of power MOSFET as a fast switch to obtain a high voltage with nanosecond pulse width. The motivation using Cockcroft-Walton multiplier is to acquire a low-cost high voltage DC generator; it will use capacitors and diodes arranged like a step. Power MOSFET connected in series is used as voltage divider to share the high voltage in order not to damage them. Results: This design is expected to acquire a low-cost generator that can achieve the high voltage pulse in amount of −1.5 kV with falltime 3 ns and risetime 15 ns into a 50Ω load that will be used for nsPEFs purposes. Further detailed on the circuit design will be explained at presentation.},

	abstract = {A home-made and low-cost basic logic kit equipped with lecture notes has been developed. The main purpose of developing this kit is to support undergraduate students in learning basic digital system, which is delivered in the digital electronics topic of Basic Electronics-2 course, at Physics Department, Surabaya State University. This kit consists of input switches, output indicators, a battery, and several logic gates, i.e. AND, OR, INVERTER, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, which are assembled on a matrix board and plywood. The kit, which was packed in a plastic box and its front panel was made from a glossy photo paper, is simply portable to be used in classroom and laboratory. The lecture notes contain of digital system principle with emphasis on practical experiments and applications. The kit and the lecture notes were composed so that students easily understand those using provided examples to conduct experiments of digital logic. They were developed using a 4-D model that includes define, design, develop, and disseminate. The usefulness of the kit and the readability of the lecture notes were evaluated by distributing a questionnaire to 20 students taking the course. It was found that the students give the score of 4.6, 4.15, 4.03, 4 out of 5 for content, language, helpful for understanding basic logic, and layout, respectively, which indicate that the kit and the lecture, notes is advantageous tools in achieving better understanding of basic digital system.},

We also proposed an equivalent circuit for this solar cell. The value of the charge-transfer resistance was determined both experimentally and analytically, and we found that both approaches produced the same results.

To gain control of crystallite/particle size, synthesis temperature (120–1300°C) and initial precursor concentration (2.5–15 mmol/L) were investigated, which were then compared with the proposal of the particle formation mechanism. The results showed that both crystallite and particle sizes played an important role in photocatalytic activity.

Combining of tungsten trioxide (WO3) with titanium dioxide (TiO2) have been an interesting research subject because different from conventional TiO2 material, this composite can be used and activated under visible-light irradiation and has better photocatalytic efficiency. The purpose of this study was to synthesize composite WO3/TiO2 nanoparticles and to investigate the detail effect of composition of ammonium metatungstate (AMT, as a WO3 source) and titanium isopropoxide (TTIP, as a TiO2 source) in the wide range composition ratio on particle morphology (i.e.,outer size (from 20 to 90nm), shape, and structure), crystallinity, and photocatalytic performance. To synthesize composite WO3/TiO2 nanoparticles, a flame-assisted spray-pyrolysis method was used. Experimental results showed that the amount of AMT (from 0 to 25wt\%) had shown a significant impact on the photocatalytic performance, however deviation of this amount had improve catalyst performance slightly. The change of photocatalytic activity is mainly influenced by band gap energy and surface area. To confirm the fundamental reason for this catalytic improvement, the effect of WO3 and TiO2 amounts on surface area, light absorbance, and charge separation analysis was investigated. The experimental results were also completed along with the proposal photocatalytic mechanism of particles containing WO3 and TiO2. In addition, although our present photocatalytic activity still needs to be improved, the present results open new information for creating more varied properties for application explorations.},

The model foundation is the microscopic mechanism in GMR, where the GMR effect can be explained by intrinsic and extrinsic potential. The potentials are spin-dependent. The potentials determine the transmission probability then it will give conductance value. Here, the multiple barrier potential model is proposed as the new GMR model. The transmission probability is determined using transfer matrix method. It was found that this model is fit qualitatively with the typical GMR graph.},

	abstract = {A facile, economic and environmentally friendly one-step approach for the preparation of highly luminescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) was developed using a hydrothermal reaction between citric acid and urea. Unlike previous reports, we focused on the effect of the transient nature of GQD formation on the photoluminescence (PL) properties and molecular structure changes of the products. We found that the GQDs have an optimum reaction time and require an effective precursor to achieve excellent luminescent properties. The PL, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption, zeta potential, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of the GQDs prepared at various reaction times revealed that the molecular structures responsible for the luminescence of the GQDs are aggregates or condensation products of citric acid amides. We found that urea addition to the precursor drastically enhances the PL intensity of the GQDs, and it is 40 times higher than those prepared using the pure citric acid precursor. Additionally, a GQDs–polyvinyl alcohol composite achieved an excellent quantum yield (QY) of 43.6\%.},

The simplicity offered by this method made some complex system in physics such as moving interface in multiphase flow, heat conductivity jumping in multiple material boundaries and many geometrical difficulties become relative easy to calculate. We will treat a relative easy example of melting process to test the method in solving fluid motion equation coupled by heat transfer process. The main heat transfer processes are caused by solid-liquid (medium to medium) heat diffusion and convection. System interaction with ambient temperature can be modeled by gas surrounding fluid-solid system. For the ambient temperature, we proposed surface particle heat transfer governed by convectional heat flux. Using local particle number density value as surface detection method, we applied cooling and heating to surface particle on the melting ice cube and water system. The simulation result is also verified by experiment.},

This result does not change when there is an extra Hamiltonian term. We have also applied these two scenarios in AQC to a Hadamard gate. Adding an extra Hamiltonian gives a non-trivial result compared to the normal AQC, however it does not result in a speed-up. Moreover, we show that in these two scenarios we can choose an arbitrary path provided that it satisfies the boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {Recycling option of spent nuclear fuels (SFN) from the reactors is one of the hot issues in term of fuel utilization of recycling fuel for extending sustainability of nuclear fuel as well as nuclear non-proliferation because of plutonium utilization. The potential risk of plutonium utilization can be reduced by maintaining the isotopic plutonium barrier. Plutonium barrier can be increased by producing more even-mass plutonium isotopes or by increasing the irradiation time process which can burn much more fissile material in the reactors. The present study intends to analyze some important aspects of isotopic material barrier of plutonium composition based on the composition of spent nuclear fuel of light water reactors (LWRs). Some parameters of material barrier are evaluated such as decay heat (DH) and spontaneous fission neutron (SFN) which depends on plutonium isotopic compositions. The results show that increased production of even-mass plutonium (Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242) can be easily achieved by increasing the burnup level, which also effectively reduces fissile Pu-239 production because more fissile material is consumed. Higher DH from even-mass plutonium can be achieved with higher burnup and longer cooling time because of high contribution of individual decay heat properties of even-mass plutonium especially from Pu-238 contribution. In addition, higher SFN composition can be obtained with a higher burnup level and longer cooling time, which is mainly due to the Pu-240 contribution. Higher burnup and longer cooling time are effective for increasing the even-mass plutonium composition. It is explained that higher irradiation process and cooling times are effective for increasing the proliferation resistance level of plutonium due to the level of even-mass plutonium as well as increasing the decay heat and spontaneous fission neutron as material barrier parameters.},

To achieve inherent safety capability it is important to minimized excess reactivity during burn-up to be below delayed neutron fraction value so that super prompt critical accident such as in Chernobyl accident case can be avoided.

	abstract = {Neutronic performance of small long-life boiling water reactors (BWR) with thorium nitride based fuel has been performed. A recent study conducted on BWR in tight lattice environments (with a lower moderator percentage) produces small power reactor which has some specifications, i.e. 10 years operation time, power density of 19.1 watt/cc and maximum excess reactivity of about 4\%. This excess reactivity value is smaller than standard reactivity of conventional BWR. The use of hexagonal geometry on the fuel cell of BWR provides a substantial effect on the criticality of the reactor to obtain a longer operating time. Supported by a tight concept lattice where the volume fraction of the fuel is greater than the moderator and fuel, Thorium Nitride give good results for fuel cell design on small long life BWR. The excess reactivity of the reactor can be reduced with the addition of gadolinium as burnable poisons. Therefore the hexagonal tight lattice fuel cell design of small long life BWR that has a criticality more than 20 years of operating time has been obtained.},

Full-multiplet calculations indicate that the differences in the magnetic behavior of α- and γ-CoV2O6 phases originate from different local distortions of the CoO6 octahedra. In particular, the strong compression of the CoO6 octahedra together with the unusually small octahedral crystal field splitting in α-CoV2O6 lead to a strong mixture of t2g and eg orbitals which, via the local atomic Coulomb and exchange interactions, results in an exceptionally large orbital moment.},

Going beyond the restricted case of nondissipative and nondispersive scatterers often reported previously, the current numerical calculation is performed directly on the basis of Mie's general formula, adopting the refractive index data of Johnson and Christy. Our result does not show the appearance of well resolved and multipole resonances in Qsca plotted against q(= 2πa/λ), for certain wire radii. It does show however, the growing contributions of the higher order modes as a increases. A series of closely-placed but well separated resonance curves nevertheless show up for varying wire radii within the range of small q, exhibiting systematic changes indicative of the size effects on the scattered waves. The further deduced Qsca(λ) spectra display the distinct resonance curves for different wire radii showing peculiar mix of monotonous and nonmonotonous variations of the resonance peak and spectral width with increasing a, as a result of complicated competitions among the growing contributions of the higher order modes. Finally, while the silver and gold scatterers appear to exhibit qualitatively similar behaviors, they differ largely in details due to the significantly different indices of refraction and dispersive properties.},

Specifically, the Rosenbloom–Tsfasman weight for vector codes satisfies the extension theorem, whereas the Niederreiter–Rosenbloom–Tsfasman weight for matrix codes does not. A short character-theoretic proof of the well-known MacWilliams extension theorem for the homogeneous weight is provided. Moreover it is shown that the extension theorem carries over to direct products of weights, but not to symmetrized products.},

Unavailability of medication to cure the transmission in human blood becomes a global health issue in recent decades. World epidemiologists are encouraged to focus on investigation toward an effective and inexpensive way to prevent dengue transmission, i.e. mosquito control. In this paper, we present a model depicting the dynamics of mosquito population based on indoor–outdoor life cycle classification. The basic mosquito offspring number is obtained and analysis of equilibria is shown. We bring along a discussion on application of optimal control model which engineers two simultaneous schemes. The first scheme is done by disseminating chemical like Temephos in spots where eggs and larvae develop, meanwhile the second scheme is done by conducting fumigation through areas where adult mosquitoes prevalently nest, indoor as well as outdoor. A version of gradient-based method is presented to set down a workflow in minimizing the objective functional with respect to control variable. Numerical results from analysis of the basic mosquito offspring number with constant control and from optimal control suggest that one has to enhance the usage of fumigation rather than Temephos. It is also suggested that applying both control schemes simultaneously gives the most significant reduction to the population.},

	abstract = {Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized with variable microwave power in the range of 100–450W, and the resulting enhancement of MSN crystal growth was evaluated for the adsorption and release of ibuprofen. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that the MSN prepared under the highest microwave power (MSN450) produced the most crystallized and prominent mesoporous structure. Enhancement of the crystal growth improved the hexagonal order and range of silica, which led to greater surface area, pore width and pore volume. MSN450exhibited higher ibuprofen adsorption (98.3mg/g), followed by MSN300(81.3mg/g) and MSN100(74.1mg/g), confirming that more crystallized MSN demonstrated higher adsorptivity toward ibuprofen. Significantly, MSN450 also contained more hydroxyl groups that provided more adsorption sites. In addition, MSN450 exhibited comparable ibuprofen adsorption with conventionally synthesized MSN, indicating the potential of microwave treatment in the synthesis of related porous materials. In vitrodrug release was also investigated with simulated biological fluids and the kinetics was studied under different pH conditions. MSN450showed the slowest release rate of ibuprofen, followed by MSN300 and MSN100. This was due to the wide pore diameter and longer range of silica order of the MSN450. Ibuprofen release from MSN450 at pH 5 and 7 was found to obey a zero-order kinetic model, while release at pH 2 followed the Kosmeyer–Peppas model.},

However, the detailed evolution during the CMS formation templated by self-assembly of chiral surfactants have not been clearly explained. In this study, we reported the evolutional formation of CMS which was understood by complementary analyses involving advanced techniques such as spectroscopy, microscopy and thermogravimetry. The samples were kinetically studied starting from the time intervals during precursors mixing until fully well-ordered CMS was obtained. Insignificant interactions between C14AlaA and APS were observed at the initiate state and the interaction was becoming crucial for the CMS formation. Additionally, we also speculated that the electrostatic interaction between NH2 group and COO− anionic head group on the micelle surface is the driving force for the CMS formation.},

Catalytic testing was conducted in the temperature range of 423–723K under atmospheric pressure in the presence of H2. Ni supported on MSN was compared with others types of support such as MCM-41 (Mobile Crystalline Material), HY (protonated Y zeolite), SiO2 and γ-Al2O3. The activity of CO2 methanation followed the order: Ni/MSN{\textgreater}Ni/MCM-41{\textgreater}Ni/HY{\textgreater}Ni/SiO2{\textgreater}Ni/γ-Al2O3. The nitrogen physisorption and pyrrole adsorbed IR spectroscopy results indicated that the high activity of Ni/MSN is due to the presence of both intra- and inter-particle porosity which led to the high concentration of basic sites. In addition, the correlation between N–H band intensity and the turnover frequency revealed that the methanation activity increased with increasing of the concentration of basic sites. The presence of defect sites or oxygen vacancies in MSN was responsible for the formation of surface carbon species, while Ni sites dissociated hydrogen to form atomic hydrogen. The surface carbon species then interacted with atomic hydrogen to form methane. The Ni/MSN catalyst performed with good stability and no deactivation up to 200h.},

	abstract = {The hexagonal structure of the mesostructured silica nanoparticles (MSN) based solid acid catalyst was synthesized using 1,2-propanediol as a co-solvent by sol–gel method, followed by aluminum grafting and protonation. The activity of the catalysts was tested for cumene conversion in a pulse microcatalytic reactor at 323–573K. XRD, TEM and N2 physisorption results confirmed the hexagonal ordered structure with a pore diameter of 3.4–4.0nm, a particle size of 70–120nm and a surface area of 588–995m2/g. Solid state NMR and IR results confirmed that the aluminum grafting and protonation form framework and extra-framework aluminums which led to generating strong Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. High activity in the cumene conversion was only observed on HAlMSN producing propylene, benzene, toluene via a cracking on protonic acid sites and producing a main product of α-methylstyrene via a dehydrogenation on Lewis acidic sites at high reaction temperature. While only α-methylstyrene and higher hydrocarbon (⩾C10) were produced at low reaction temperature showing the permanent Brønsted acid sites did not involve in the cumene conversion. It is suggested that the presence of hydrogen and strong Lewis acid sites increased the stability and activity of the HAlMSN catalyst in the cumene conversion. Although the small deactivation of HAlMSN was observed during the reaction due to the formation of small coke deposits on the surface, the reactivation recovered the activity of catalyst and the high activity was still observed after 60h of reaction. The high stability and activity of HAlMSN in the cumene conversion can be considered as a method for the production of α-methylstyrene via a dehydrogenation process.},

The formation of Pt nanoparticles occurs at the surface and the inside of the BC membrane by reducing the precursor solution with a hydrogen gas reductant. The Pt nanoparticles obtained from the variations of precursor concentration, between 3 mM and 30 mM, and the formation of Pt nanoparticles have been studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). Based on X-ray diffraction patterns, Pt particles have sizes between 6.3 nm and 9.3 nm, and the Pt particle size increases with an increase in precursor concentration. The morphology of the Pt nanoparticles was observed by SEM-EDS and the content of Pt particles inside the membrane is higher than that on the surface of BC membranes. This analysis corresponds to the TGA analysis, but the TGA analysis is more representative in how it describes the content of Pt particles in the BC membrane.},

	abstract = {This study aims to investigate the use of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) seeds, a solid agricultural waste, as a novel adsorbent for the adsorption of Congo red (CR) from aqueous solution in batch mode. Experiments were carried out as a function of contact time, dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, pH, and temperature. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips adsorption isotherm models were applied to describe isotherm parameters. The results showed that equilibrium contact time was 90 min. The experimental results indicate that, the percentage of dye adsorption increases with an increase in the adsorbent dosages and temperature. The CR adsorption percentage decreased with increasing dye concentration and pH solution from 3 to 12. Thermodynamic parameters data indicated that the CR adsorption process was non-spontaneous and endothermic under the experimental conditions, with the Gibbs free energy (∆G°) in the range of 9.13–8.12 kJ/mol, enthalpy (∆H°) and entropy (∆S°) of 14.15 kJ/mol and 16.85 J/mol, respectively. The Langmuir isotherm model fit the equilibrium data better than both the Freundlich and Sips isotherm models, with adsorption capacity 9.82 mg/g. The kinetic data for adsorption processes were described by pseudo-second-order model with a rate constant in the range of 0.043–0.156 g mg/g min−1. The rubber seeds investigated in this study showed a high potential use for the adsorption of CR from aqueous solution.},

The measurements permit the identification of the spectral occupancy over those selected sites in reference to the allocated radio spectrum in Indonesia. The sites are in close proximity to Australia, the future host of Square Kilometre Array (SKA) at low frequency. Therefore, the survey was deliberately made to approximately adhere the SKA protocol for RFI measurements, but with lower sensitivity. The RFI environment at Bosscha Observatory in Lembang was also measured for comparison. Within the sensitivity limit of the measurement equipment, it is found that a location called Fatumonas in the surrounding of Mount Timau in West Timor has very low level of RFI, with a total spectrum occupancy in this measured frequency range being about 1 \%, mostly found at low frequency below 20 MHz. More detailed measurements as well as a strategy for a radio quiet zone must be implemented in the near future.},

The hybrid composite polymer was composed of siloxane and ethylene glycol polymer networks. Their working performances were investigated by the current-voltage (J-V) characterizations and small ac impedance measurements, which are correlated with the concentrations of ionic liquid electrolyte.

A set of control systems are required in order to operate a fuel cell based power plant system optimally. For the purpose of control system design, an accurate fuel cell stack model in describing the dynamics of the real system is needed. Currently, linear model are widely used for fuel cell stack control purposes, but it has limitations in narrow operation range. While nonlinear models lead to nonlinear control implemnetation whos more complex and hard computing. In this research, nonlinear cancellation technique will be used to transform a nonlinear model into a linear form while maintaining the nonlinear characteristics. The transformation is done by replacing the input of the original model by a certain virtual input that has nonlinear relationship with the original input. Then the equality of the two models is tested by running a series of simulation. Input variation of H2, O2 and H2O as well as disturbance input I (current load) are studied by simulation. The error of comparison between the proposed model and the original nonlinear model are less than 1 \%. Thus we can conclude that nonlinear cancellation technique can be used to represent fuel cell nonlinear model in a simple linear form while maintaining the nonlinear characteristics and therefore retain the wide operation range.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a new approach for investigating the seismic wave velocity of rock, specifically carbonates, as affected by their pore structures. While the conventional routine of seismic velocity measurement highly depends on the extensive laboratory experiment, the proposed approach utilizes the digital rock physics view which lies on the numerical experiment. Thus, instead of using core sample, we use the thin section image of carbonate rock to measure the effective seismic wave velocity when travelling on it. In the numerical experiment, thin section images act as the medium on which wave propagation will be simulated. For the modeling, an advanced technique based on artificial neural network was employed for building the velocity and density profile, replacing image's RGB pixel value with the seismic velocity and density of each rock constituent. Then, ultrasonic wave was simulated to propagate in the thin section image by using finite difference time domain method, based on assumption of an acoustic-isotropic medium. Effective velocities were drawn from the recorded signal and being compared to the velocity modeling from Wyllie time average model and Kuster-Toksoz rock physics model. To perform the modeling, image analysis routines were undertaken for quantifying the pore aspect ratio that is assumed to represent the rocks pore structure. In addition, porosity and mineral fraction required for velocity modeling were also quantified by using integrated neural network and image analysis technique. It was found that the Kuster-Toksoz gives the closer prediction to the measured velocity as compared to the Wyllie time average model. We also conclude that Wyllie time average that does not incorporate the pore structure parameter deviates significantly for samples having more than 40\% porosity. Utilizing this approach we found a good agreement between numerical experiment and theoretically derived rock physics model for estimating the effective seismic wave velocity of rock.},

The main purposes of this paper are to find how the change of interest rate affects economic growth and to use the relationship in prognostication of economic growth. By using expenditure model, a linear relationship between economic growth and interest rate is developed. The result is then used for prediction by normal copula and Vine Archimedean copula. It is shown that increasing interest rate to tackle inflation is a poor solution.

The purpose of GSTAR(1,1) model is to forecast the next time red-chili prices at those markets. The model is identified by sample space-time ACF and space-time PACF, and model parameters are estimated by least square estimation method. Theoretically, the errors’ independency assumption could simplify the parameter estimation’s problem. However, practically that assumption is hard to satisfy since the errors may be correlated each other’s. In red-chili prices modeling, it is considered that the process has time-correlated errors, i.e. martingale difference process, instead of follow normal distribution. Here, we do some simulations to investigate the behavior of errors’ assumptions. Although some of results show that the behavior of the errors’ model are not always followed the martingale difference process, it does not corrupt the goodness of GSTAR(1,1) model to forecast the red-chili prices at those five markets.},

One of its benefits is to help a company for budgeting marketing expenditure for customer acquisition and customer retention. Many mathematical models have been introduced to calculate CLV considering the customer retention/migration classification scheme. A fairly new class of these models which will be described in this paper uses Markov Chain Models (MCM). This class of models has the major advantage for its flexibility to be modified to several different cases/classification schemes. In this model, the probabilities of customer retention and acquisition play an important role. From Pfeifer and Carraway, 2000, the final formula of CLV obtained from MCM usually contains nonlinear form of the transition probability matrix. This nonlinearity makes the inverse problem of CLV difficult to solve. This paper aims to solve this inverse problem, yielding the approximate transition probabilities for the customers, by applying metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed by Yang, 2013, Flower Pollination Algorithm. The major interpretation of obtaining the transition probabilities are to set goals for marketing teams in keeping the relative frequencies of customer acquisition and customer retention.},

	abstract = {Nowadays some firms, including insurer firms, think that customer-centric services are better than product-centric ones in terms of marketing. Insurance firms will try to attract as many new customer as possible while maintaining existing customer. This causes the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) becomes a very important thing. CLV are able to put customer into different segments and calculate the present value of a firm’s relationship with its customer. Insurance customer will depend on the last service he or she can get. So if the service is bad now, then customer will not renew his contract though the service is very good at an erlier time. Because of this situation one suitable mathematical model for modeling customer’s relationships and calculating their lifetime value is Markov Chain. In addition, the advantages of using Markov Chain Modeling is its high degree of flexibility. In 2000, Pfeifer and Carraway states that Markov Chain Modeling can be used for customer retention situation. In this situation, Markov Chain Modeling requires only two states, which are present customer and former ones. This paper calculates customer lifetime value in an insurance firm with two distinctive interest rates; the constant interest rate and uniform distribution of interest rates. The result shows that loyal customer and the customer who increase their contract value have the highest CLV.},

The momentum conservative scheme pursued here is shown to be suitable for 1D problems such as transcritical flow with a shock and dam break over a rectangular bed, and we also found that our simulation of dam break over a dry sloping bed is in good agreement with the exact solution. Further, the results obtained using the generalised momentum conservative approximation for 2D shallow water equations to simulate wave run up on a conical island are in good agreement with benchmark experimental data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we construct a probability distribution for flight departure delay durations. The probability distribution is developed by fitting historical departure delay data of an airline to a number of probability distributions. Then, we choose the most fitted model by applying two-stage Genetic Algorithm. In the first stage, the algorithm works for maximizing log-likelihood function, and then we proceed to the second stage by facing the optimization model for minimizing the sum of squared error. The second stage is intended to avoid getting trapped in a local optimal solution which often occurs in log-likelihood approach. Since the historical data show that at a certain time in a day a flight has a bigger probability to be delayed, we also analyze the probability distribution of flight departure delay-time by using a similar approach for distribution of flight departure delay duration. The distributions can be used by the airline for measuring the sensitivity of flight schedules, so that a robust flight schedule can be constructed.},

	abstract = {The structural transformations in PbBi4Ti4O15 (PBT) induced by decreasing the temperature from 850 to 120 K were investigated using Raman spectroscopy. The temperature evolution of phonon modes revealed structural alterations in PBT occurred near 800, 600, and 400 K. The paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition at 800 K was clearly observed in the temperature behavior of the low-energy phonon mode at 60 cm−1 that has been previously attributed to a displacement of the Bi2O2 plane with respect to the Aurivillius perovskite-like block, emphasizing that this is the phonon mode driving the system into a ferroelectric state. The structural transformation near 600 K was identified from the mode at 40 cm−1 related to Pb/Bi vibrations in the perovskite-like block as well as modes at 130 and 220 cm−1 caused by octahedral tilting of TiO6. The temperature of this structural alteration matches the second anomaly observed in the dielectric permittivity of PBT, so it causes minor spontaneous polarization in this material. The temperature dependence of the mode at 60 cm−1 also revealed a structural transformation at 400 K that is not related to the ferroelectric properties of PBT.},

Many studies have been done to understand the effect of PCBM to the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM blend and to performance of its solar cells. However, the clearly explanation about the effect of PCBM to the charge carrier dynamics in P3HT is not well understood yet. We have studied charge carrier dynamics in active material of solar cell P3HT:PCBM along and perpendicular to the chain by means of longitudinal field (LF) muon-spin-relaxation (µSR) method to elucidate the intra and inter-chain charge carrier in polymer hybrid P3HT:PCBM. We found the charge carrier transport changes from intra-chain to inter-chain diffusion. One dimensional intra-chain diffusion is observed in the samples at low temperatures below 10K, while three dimensional inter-chain is observed at high temperatures above 15K. This temperature is lower than that of P3HT only.},

In this paper, we provide upper bounds for the locating-chromatic numbers of connectedgraphs obtained from disconnected graphs where each component contains a single dominant vertex.},

The purified α-amylase variants demonstrated starch hydrolysis resulting in a mixture of maltose, maltotriose, and glucose, similar to the wild type enzyme. Introduction of the disulphide bridge shifted the melting temperature (TM) from 54.5 to 56°C and nearly tripled the enzyme half-life time at 65°C. The two variants have similar kcat/KM values. Similarly, inhibition by acarbose was only slightly affected, with the IC50 of Sfamy02 for acarbose being 40±3.4μM, while that of Sfamy01 was 31±3.9μM. On the other hand, the IC50 of Sfamy02 for EDTA was 0.45mM, nearly two times lower than that of Sfamy01 at 0.77mM. These results show that the introduction of a disulphide bridge had little effect on the enzyme activity, but made the enzyme more susceptible to calcium ion extraction. Altogether, the new disulphide bridge improved the enzyme stability without affecting its activity, although minor changes in the active site environment cannot be excluded.},

The results showed that various variables such as base-emitter voltage, base-collector voltage and the AGNR width affect the Dirac electron tunneling current. It was found that the Dirac electron tunneling current increases with increasing base-emitter and base-collector voltages. Moreover, the increase in the AGNR width results in the increase in the Dirac electron tunneling current.},

A solution of baby oil was placed in a plastic container, 4.5 × 4.5 × 1 inches, with both ends of the electrodes (metal wire) immersed in the solution at a depth of 0.2 inches. A mosquito racket was used as a source of voltage, and was connected to the electrodes. Electric field lines were seen through grass seeds, which were sown in the solution of baby oil. The results showed the design tool successfully evokes the lines of force of an electric field from a charge point, two point charges, and two dielectric plates with two polar opposite charges.},

	abstract = {The Pt nanoparticles have been synthesized in situ using bacterial cellulose (BC) membranes as the matrix. The BC was immersed in a solution of PtCl4 and H2PtCl6 as Pt(IV) precursors also in surfactant stabilized Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) as carbon source. Then, the Pt(IV) was reduced by hydrogen gas. Two routes have been applied for the insertion Pt particles; in the first route the Pt particles were inserted before the insertion of MWCNT and in the second route the other way around was applied. The products of these two insertion routes for each precursor are designated as BC-PtPtCl4-MWCNT, BC-PtH2PtCl6-MWCNT for the first route and BC-MWCNT-PtPtCl4, BC-MWCNT-PtH2PtCl6 for the second route, respectively. Both routes revealed that the Pt particles insertion in BC depends on the type of precursors and insertion routes, as seen from the morphology and Pt particles content. The first route produces Pt diameter of 26 nm while the second one 42 nm. The use of PtCl4 in the first route resulted in higher content of Pt particles (50\%) compared to H2PtCl6 (39\%). On the other hand, the type of precursor did not give any significant effect to the content of Pt inserted; both gave 29\% of Pt to the second route. The high Pt content observed on the BC-PtPtCl4-MWCNT membrane surface is possible because PtCl4 precursor forms H2[PtCl4(OH)2] that initially can be bound via hydrogen bonding to the BC backbone. It is concluded that smaller size and high content of Pt particles have been obtained from PtCl4 precursor, the distribution of Pt particles and MWCNT are almost homogenous in the BC-PtPtCl4-MWCNT membrane derived from precursor PtCl4.},

	abstract = {Organic solar cells have been much studied because of the simplicity in their fabrication process in comparison to solar cells based on crystalline inorganic semiconductors. However, the actual power conversion efficiency is still much lower than the theoretical prediction, which may indicate the effect of inefficient charge transfer or charge recombination loss inside the cell. We have studied the photovoltaic characteristics of hybrid solar cells with transition metal doped ZnO layer as electron transport layers. Under dark condition, their J-V curves show a deviation from an ideal diode characteristic, which is indicated by current flow below the threshold voltage. Further investigations to clarify the photovoltaic characteristics of those cells were then carried out by the measurements of impedance spectroscopy. The impedance characteristics are dependent on the transport layer used, where the Nyquist plots of cells with TiZO exhibit larger impedance than those of cells with ZnO. However, those cells with larger impedance show better working performances. This fact was then interpreted as the result from smaller interfacial charge transfer loss, which may take place via charge carrier recombination at the interface of the transport layer and active layer, in the cells with TiZO.},

The emission wavelength of the phosphors varied with the mixing ratio of raw materials and it was found that lowering the proportion of urea to boric acid or citric acid tended to increase the internal quantum yield and shorten the emission wavelength under excitation at 365nm. It was also found for the first time that a light-emitting polymer could be synthesized from a mixture of the prepared BCNO nanoparticles and a polyvinyl alcohol. This polymer composite exhibited uniform dispersion and stabilization of the luminescence and had a high internal quantum yield of 54\%, which was higher than that of the phosphor alone.},

	abstract = {A Raman spectroscopy study on the half-doped single-layer manganite Pr0.5Ca1.5MnO4 has been performed in combination with x-ray diffraction, resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The results provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of phenomena that arise from correlations between lattice, charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom. The appearance of a new Raman mode at 366cm−1, a visible jump in the resistivity, and a doubling of the unit cell signify the onset of charge/orbital ordering at 320 K. This transition is also marked by a sharp peak in the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat, suggesting strong spin-charge coupling. Our structural analysis suggests that the charge disproportionation below 320 K is small. Orbital fluctuations below 320 K are evidenced by the evolution with temperature of the Jahn-Teller Raman mode (situated at 533cm−1 at 320 K). A coincidence between the onset of two-dimensional short-range antiferromagnetic order at 215 K and anomalies in both the temperature dependence of the Jahn-Teller mode and the Mn-O bonding pattern in the ab plane indicate that the short-range magnetic order plays a role in stabilizing the orbital fluctuations. Below the Néel temperature of 127 K, the softening of both the 366cm−1 mode and an octahedral tilting mode at 214cm−1 mark the onset of three-dimensional antiferromagnetic ordering. The estimated spin-phonon coupling constants for these two modes are 2.6 and 6.8cm−1, respectively. This study highlights the remarkable coupling of charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom to the lattice in single-layer Pr0.5Ca1.5MnO4.},

Characterization results illustrated that the photoactivity was affected by the amount of Ag0 and oxygen vacancies which act as an electrons trap to enhance the electron–hole separation. While, the AgOTi bonds formation reduced the photoactivity. The degradation followed a pseudo-first order Langmuir–Hinshelwood model where adsorption was the controlling step.

	abstract = {Estimating the basic reproductive ratio of dengue fever has continued to be an ever-increasing challenge among epidemiologists. In this paper we propose two different constructions to estimate which is derived from a dynamical system of host-vector dengue transmission model. The construction is based on the original assumption that in the early states of an epidemic the infected human compartment increases exponentially at the same rate as the infected mosquito compartment (previous work). In the first proposed construction, we modify previous works by assuming that the rates of infection for mosquito and human compartments might be different. In the second construction, we add an improvement by including more realistic conditions in which the dynamics of an infected human compartments are intervened by the dynamics of an infected mosquito compartment, and vice versa. We apply our construction to the real dengue epidemic data from SB Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, during the period of outbreak Nov. 25, 2008–Dec. 2012. We also propose two scenarios to determine the take-off rate of infection at the beginning of a dengue epidemic for construction of the estimates of : scenario I from equation of new cases of dengue with respect to time (daily) and scenario II from equation of new cases of dengue with respect to cumulative number of new cases of dengue. The results show that our first construction of accommodates the take-off rate differences between mosquitoes and humans. Our second construction of the estimation takes into account the presence of infective mosquitoes in the early growth rate of infective humans and vice versa. We conclude that the second approach is more realistic, compared with our first approach and the previous work.},

The model involves parameters such as the density and viscosity of the fluids, the gravity, and the property of the surface which is characterized by so called the slip coefficient. The front-tracking method is used to solve numerically the free boundary motion of the interface. To maintain the conservation of mass during the numerical procedure, a weighted factor with a certain condition is introduced to calculate the update surfactant concentration, for each iteration. Results show that the surfactant affects the drop to accelerate its detachment from the solid substrate, and the slip coefficient turns out to be the crucial factor for the magnitude of the contact line movement.},

Using nuclear forward scattering the collinear spin structure at temperatures below about 11 K could be confirmed, whereas the nuclear forward scattering results in the intermediate temperature range between about 11 K and 14 K are incompatible with the assumption of a sinusoidal distribution of spins parallel to the c axis of CuFeO2. The critical behavior of the average hyperfine field at the phase transition at about 14 K further supports a three-dimensional model for the magnetism in this compound. Moreover, using nuclear inelastic scattering by the 57Fe Mössbauer resonance, Fe-specific lattice dynamics are found to be strongly anisotropic with stiffer bonds in the ab plane of the crystal. The powder averaged, Fe partial density of phonon states can be well modeled using ab initio calculations and low-energy phonons are found to deviate from classical Debye-like behavior, indicating spin-phonon coupling in this compound. Besides, the theoretical phonon spectrum exhibits typical characteristics for delafossite-type material.},

The oxidation study of palm oil is conducted in the presence of zeolite nanocrystals (0.5 wt \%) at 150 °C. Several characterization techniques such as visual analysis, colorimetry, rheometry, total acid number (TAN), FT-IR spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and Karl Fischer analyses are applied to follow the oxidative evolution of the oil. It was found that zeolite nanocrystals decelerate the oxidation of palm oil through stabilization of hydroperoxides, which are the primary oxidation product, and concurrently via adsorption of the secondary oxidation products (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters). In addition to the experimental results, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to elucidate further the oxidation process of the palm oil in the presence of zeolite nanocrystals. The DFT calculations show that the metal complexes formed with peroxides are more stable than the complexes with alkenes with the same ions. The peroxides captured in the zeolite X nanocrystals consequently decelerate further oxidation toward formation of acids. Unlike the monovalent alkali metal cations in the zeolite X nanocrystals (K+, Na+, and Li+), Ca2+ reduced the acidity of the oil by neutralizing the acidic carboxylate compounds to COO–(Ca2+)1/2 species.},

The IR results reveal that zeolite nanoparticles are able to stabilize the oxidative propagation agent such as peroxides, and limit the polymerization products in the palm oil. A mechanism describing the inhibition of palm oil oxidation in the presence of zeolite nanoparticles is proposed.

Antioxidants are probably the most important additives used in oils because oxidative deterioration plays a major role in oil degradation. Zeolite nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven as another option as green antioxidants in oil formulation. The anti-oxidative behavior of zeolite NPs is obvious; however, the phenomenon is still under investigation. Herein, a study of the effect of extra-framework cations stabilized on Linde Type L (LTL) zeolite NPs (ca. 20 nm) on inhibition of oxidation in palm oil-based lubricant oil is reported. Hydrophilic LTL zeolites with a Si/Al ratio of 3.2 containing four different inorganic cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+) were applied. The oxidation of the lubricant oil was followed by visual observation, colorimetry, fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, total acid number (TAN), and rheology analyses. The effect of extra-framework cations to slow down the rate of oil oxidation and to control the viscosity of oil is demonstrated. The degradation rate of the lubricant oil samples is decreased considerably as the polarizability of cation is increased with the presence of zeolite NPs. More importantly, the microporous zeolite NPs have a great influence in halting the steps that lead to the polymerization of the oils and thus increasing the lifetime of oils.},

XRD and FESEM analyses indicated that mZSM5s possessed a high crystalline structure with coffin-type morphology. Nitrogen physisorption analysis revealed the presence of both micropores and mesopores in high surface area mZSM5s with inter- and intra-particle porosity. The pyridine and pyrrole adsorbed IR spectroscopy results demonstrated that mZSM5s have both intrinsic acidic and basic sites, which are suitable for acid and/or base catalyzed reactions. The bare mZSM5-0.5D exhibited the highest rate of conversion of n-heptane (0.0230μmol/m2s) and CO (0.0226μmol/m2s) at 573K and 723K, respectively. The mZSM5s performed with good stability and no deactivation up to 30h for n-heptane cracking and CO methanation.

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the use of moleculary imprinted polymers (MIPs) material as an alternative adsorbent for the adsorption of humic acid (HA) from peat water in batch mode. The MIPs were prepared with methyl methacrylate as a monomer, HA as templates, ethylene glycoldimethacrylate as a cross-linker, and dimethyl formamide as a solvent. The characteristics of MIPs were evaluated using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller methods. The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips models were applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms using non-linear regression analysis. Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticles, and Boyd kinetic models were used to describe the kinetic data. The results showed that the equilibrium contact time was 60 min. The experimental results indicated that the percentage of sorption increases with an increase in the adsorbent dosage and temperature. The adsorption percentage decreased with increasing peat water pH from 2 to 12. The equilibrium data fitted well for the Langmuir adsorption isotherms, with monolayer adsorption capacity of MIPs found to be 45.45 mg/g. The results of the kinetic study show that the adsorption of HA onto MIPs could be described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with a rate constant in the range of 0.034–0.115 g/mg min and controlled by film diffusion, with the effective diffusion coefficient was found in the range of 7.42 × 10−8–13.84 × 10−8 cm2/s. Thermodynamic parameters data indicated that under the experimental conditions, the HA adsorption process was non-spontaneous and endothermic, with the Gibbs free energy (∆G°) in the range of 3.71–1.17 kJ/mol, whereas enthalpy (∆H°) and entropy (∆S°) at 16.17 and 42.70 J mol−1, respectively.},

	abstract = {Under external electric field, a free standing silicene monolayer is investigated for the physical and electronic features using the density functional theory with norm-conserving pseudopotentials and pseudo-atomic localized basis functions. It is found that silicene tends to be flat instead of buckled as applying electric field perpendicular to the surface. We observed on some range magnitude of electric field and noticed that there is a monotonic decreasing in number of DOS near the Fermi level showing the possibility of tunable bandgap on silicene. We also found that in this higher magnitude electric field, the Dirac cone is no longer occurring at K-point while the band gap term remains direct. The asymmetry onsite potential between the Si atom at site A and B spoils the degeneracy at the K point by the presence of external or internal influence. In this work, we try to combine those influences by considering Stone Wales (SW) defect and outer z-direction of electric field as internal and external factors respectively. A non-linear correlation of the result is profoundly becoming more effective way in effort to bring remarkable band-gap in silicene monolayer.},

Characterization of copolymers for enhanced oil recovery application was done by dynamic viscosity and rheological measurement. The rheological measurement indicated that the copolymer showed relatively high resistance to temperature, shear rate, and salinity compared to commercial polymers.

Calculation shows that single V atom situated

orbital of carbon and partially by the 3d like orbitals. For vanadium dimer, the stable configuration is found to be perpendicular dimer situated on the center of the hexagon. This stable vanadium dimer configuration which has not been reported in the previous works has shown enhancement
of magnetic moment per unit cell compared to an isolated dimer. The PDOS computed shows similar proportion in terms of orbital contribution as the in the case of a single vanadium atom. Moreover, vanadium dimer bond length for the favored configuration after relaxation is the same as the experimental
value of isolated dimer’s bond length indicating that perpendicular chain might be possible on graphene sheet. Thus, this study reveals that the vanadium atoms adsorbed graphene system is metallic and magnetic.},

Moreover, different plasmon modes are observed in the center and edge of the single Bi2Te3 nanoplate and a breathing mode is discovered for the first time in a non-noble metal. Theoretical calculations show that the plasmons observed in the visible range are mainly due to strong spin–orbit coupling induced metallic surface states of Bi2Te3. The versatility of shape- and size-engineered Bi2Te3 nanocrystals suggests exciting possibilities in plasmonics-enabled technology.},

Two molecular mimics, a mixture of reduced BDMCs and 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone (HPB), have been synthesized and applied as templates for MIP synthesis. The polymers were prepared using N-(2-aminoethyl) methacrylamide (EAMA) as functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) as the cross-linker (in a 1:5 molar ratio), and a mixture of acetonitrile/dimethylsulfoxide (90 \%, v/v) as porogen. MIPs prepared using a mixture of reduced BDMCs as template showed higher selectivity for CUR and BDMC than those obtained with HPB, with imprinting factors of 3.5 and 2.7 for CUR and BDMC, respectively, using H2O/acetonitrile (65:35, v/v) as mobile phase. The adsorption isotherms for CUR in the MIP and the nonimprinted polymer (NIP) were fitted to the Freundlich isotherm model, and the calculated average binding affinities for CUR were (17 ± 2) and (8 ± 1) mM−1 for the MIP and the NIP, respectively. The polymers were packed into solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, and the optimized molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE-HPLC) with fluorescence detection (FLD) method allowed the extraction of both curcuminoids from aqueous samples (50 mM NH4Ac, pH 8.8) followed by a selective washing with acetonitrile/NH4Ac, 50 mM at pH 8.8 (30:70 \%, v/v), and elution with 3 × 1 mL of MeOH. Good recoveries and precision ranging between 87 and 92 \%, with relative standard deviation (RSD) of {\textless}5.3 \% (n = 3), were obtained after the preconcentration of 10-mL solutions containing both CUR and BDMC at concentrations in the range of 0–500 μg L−1.

XRD and nitrogen sorption results confirmed the mesoporous structure with surface areas of 537–775 m2 g−1. 27Al NMR spectroscopy confirmed aluminium loading with tetrahedral, pentahedral and octahedral structures. Pyridine adsorption IR results indicated that incorporation of aluminium led to the generation of strong Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. Catalytic activity was investigated for cumene hydrocracking in a pulse microcatalytic reactor in the temperature range of 323–573 K which revealed that this activity depends on the number of Lewis and Brønsted sites. The high yield of cumene conversion increased from Si/Al molar ratios of 50 to 10 and decreased for the Si/Al molar ratio of 7 due to the presence of pentahedral Al and/or inactive tetrahedral Al atoms in Pt/HAlMSN-7. The high selectivity of α-methylstyrene showed the important role of Lewis acid sites in these bifunctional catalysts. In spite of the coke formation in the Pt/HAlMSN catalysts, reactivation recovered the activity of the catalysts after 100 h of reaction. The molar absorption coefficients of Pt/HAlMSN were measured using pyridine followed by water adsorption monitored by FTIR.},

Characterization results illustrated that the photoactivity was affected by the amount of Ag0 and oxygen vacancies which act as an electrons trap to enhance the electron–hole separation. While, the AgOTi bonds formation reduced the photoactivity. The degradation followed a pseudo-first order Langmuir–Hinshelwood model where adsorption was the controlling step. Study on the effect of scavengers showed that the hole (H+) and hydroxyl radical (OH) play important roles in the photodegradation.

The adsorbents were characterized by XRD, TEM, FTIR, 27Al MAS NMR, XPS, and VSM. The results showed that besides NiO nanoparticles, a NiAl2O4 spinel was also formed in Ni/Al2O3-E during the electrolysis via the dealumination and isomorphous substitution of Ni2+ ions. In contrast, only agglomerated NiO was found in the Ni/Al2O3-PM. Adsorption test on removal of Pd2+ ions from aqueous solution showed that the Pd2+ ions were exchanged with the hydrogen atoms of the surface–OH groups of both adsorbents. Significantly, the Ni/Al2O3-E demonstrated a higher adsorption towards Pd2+ ions than Ni/Al2O3-PM due to its remarkably higher degree of magnetism, which came from the NiAl2O4. The use of 0.1gL−1 Ni/Al2O3-E gave the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (qm) of 40.3mgg−1 at 303K and pH 5. The Ni/Al2O3-E showed high potential for simultaneous removal of various noble and transition metal ions and could be also used repetitively without affecting the high adsorptivity for Pd2+ ions.

	abstract = {The mathematical model for a profit-loss sharing scheme is formulated in order to see how this scheme can replace the traditional practice of lending money against high interest by usurers. It is sourced from the musyarakah method in Islamic Syariah law and implemented for small-scale investments of traditional-market traders. They are the common target of usurers, so they may end up poorer than they were before. The main goal of the model is to find the appropriate portion of profit share, so the investment is profitable not only for the investor but also for the trader. There are three main problems in the process of formulating the mathematical model and finding optimized results. The first problem is providing the appropriate amount of data to be implemented in the model. The second problem is determining the objective function for the optimization of the portion of profit share. The last problem is determining the appropriate values of the parameters for certain types of traders. We found a significant result in determining the appropriate values of the parameters that explain the potential capability of the traders in handling larger amounts of capital to be invested in order to achieve our main goal.},

	abstract = {ZnO-incorporated mesostructured silica nanoparticles (MSN) catalysts (ZM) were prepared by the introduction of Zn ions into the framework of MSN via a simple electrochemical system in the presence of various concentrations of NH4OH aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were studied by XRD, 29Si MAS NMR, nitrogen adsorption–desorption, FE-SEM, TEM, FTIR, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Characterization results demonstrated that the alkaline aqueous electrolyte simply generated abundant silanol groups on the surface of the catalysts as a consequence of desilication to form the hierarchical-like structure of the MSN. Subsequent restructuring of the silica network by the creation of oxygen vacancies and formation of Si–O–Zn during the electrolysis, as well as formation of new Si–O–Si bonds during calcination seemed to be the main factors that enhanced the catalytic performance of photodecolorization of methyl orange. A ZM prepared in the presence of 1.0M NH4OH (ZM-1.0) was determined to be the most effective catalyst. The catalyst displays a higher first-order kinetics rate of 3.87×10−1h−1 than unsupported ZnO (1.13×10−1h−1) that prepared under the same conditions in the absence of MSN. The experiment on effect of scavengers showed that hydroxyl radicals generated from the three main sources; reduced O2 at the conduction band, decomposed water at the valence band and irradiated H2O2 in the solution, are key factors that influenced the reaction. It is also noted that the recycled ZM-1.0 catalyst maintained its activity up to five runs without serious catalyst deactivation.},

	abstract = {We propose a design for realizing quantum charge pump based on a recent proposal for a molecular motor (Seldenthuis J S et al 2010 ACS Nano 4 6681). Our design is based on the presence of a moiety with a permanent dipole moment which can rotate, thereby modulating the couplings to metallic contacts at both ends of the molecule. Using the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green’s function formalism (NEGF), we show that our design indeed generates a pump current. In the non-interacting pump, the variation of frequency from adiabatic to non-adiabatic regime, can be used to control the direction as well as the amplitude of the average current. The effect of Coulomb interaction is considered within the first- and the second- order perturbation. The numerical implementation of the scheme is quite demanding, and we develop an analytical approximation to obtain a speed-up giving results within a reasonable time. We find that the amplitude of the average pumped current can be controlled by both the driving frequency and the Coulomb interaction. The direction of of pumped current is shown to be determined by the phase difference between left and right anchoring groups.},

ECVT system consists of shaped-helmet sensors, 32-channel data acquisition system, and a computer for image reconstruction process and display the results of scanning. Based on the experimental
results, the electrical signals from the electrode capacitance shows a clear distinction, when subjects listened to classical, pop and rock music. Furthermore, it also showed that the brain electrical signal of right hemisphere is higher than the left hemisphere when listening to music. These
results from ECVT are consistent with the results of measurement using EEG. Analysis of the reconstructed image show that there is an increase in brain activity in the temporal lobe when listening to rock music when compared to the classical music. ECVT brain scanners can be used to observe

In this study, power flattening has been conducted on the reactor core by using radially heterogeneous fuel. Addition of the Pa-231 is expected to extend lifetime of the BWR core By optimizing the composition of the fuel elements (Th and Pa) at low moderation conditions (tight lattice) it can be obtained the reactor core which can be opeprated over 30 years without refueling or fuel shuffling. The Reactor core has a volume of 17,635.8 liter, power of 620 MWt, operating life of 30 and a maximum excess reactivity value of 0.384\% dk/k, could be achieved by using a composition of U-233 enrichment of 8.1 to 11\% and the addition of Pa-231 as much as 6.16 to 11.13\% with a power density of 35.2 watts/cc.},

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis of the products shows a characteristic melting peak of the complexes at 140 °C. Compared to PTHF650, the PTHF1000 displays lower complexing ability with PTHF-b-amylose which is indicated by visible amylose retrogradation. The possible structures of the resulting products are estimated from Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) which reveals differences between PTHF-b-amylose and the corresponding complexes. In addition, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrates that the resulting structures of the complexes consist of 6-fold V-amylose helices. The results are confirmed further with Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) diffractions which show that formation of inclusion complexes increases the crystalline size and regularity of the complex. There is a strong indication that the covalently attached PTHF block also induces the formation of V-amylose by residing in between the amylose blocks. In this case, the resulting structure of the complex is likely affected by both the complexation between amylose block and the added PTHF and by the in situ  self-assembly of the block copolymers.},

	abstract = {A set of vertices S resolves a graph G if every vertex is uniquely determined by its vector of distances to the vertices in S. The metric dimension of G is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set of G.Let \{G1,G2,…,Gn\}\{G1,G2,…,Gn\}{\textbackslash}\{G\_1, G\_2, {\textbackslash}ldots , G\_n{\textbackslash}\} be a finite collection of graphs and each GiGiG\_i has a fixed vertex v0iv0iv\_\{0\_i\} or a fixed edge e0ie0ie\_\{0\_i\} called a terminal vertex or edge, respectively. The vertex-amalgamation of G1,G2,…,GnG1,G2,…,GnG\_1, G\_2, {\textbackslash}ldots , G\_n, denoted by Vertex−Amal\{Gi;v0i\}Vertex−Amal\{Gi;v0i\}Vertex-Amal{\textbackslash}\{G\_i;v\_\{0\_i\}{\textbackslash}\}, is formed by taking all the GiGiG\_i’s and identifying their terminal vertices. Similarly, the edge-amalgamation of G1,G2,…,GnG1,G2,…,GnG\_1, G\_2, {\textbackslash}ldots , G\_n, denoted by Edge−Amal\{Gi;e0i\}Edge−Amal\{Gi;e0i\}Edge-Amal{\textbackslash}\{G\_i;e\_\{0\_i\}{\textbackslash}\}, is formed by taking all the GiGiG\_i’s and identifying their terminal edges.Here we study the metric dimensions of vertex-amalgamation and edge-amalgamation for finite collection of arbitrary graphs. We give lower and upper bounds for the dimensions, show that the bounds are tight, and construct infinitely many graphs for each possible value between the bounds.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fission has been modeled notoriously using two approaches method, macroscopic and microscopic. This work will propose another approach, where the nucleus is treated as a toy model. The aim is to see the usefulness of particle distribution in fission yield calculation. Inasmuch nucleus is a toy, then the Fission Toy Model (FTM) does not represent real process in nature completely. The fission event in FTM is represented by one random number. The number is assumed as width of distribution probability of nucleon position in compound nuclei when fission process is started. By adopting the nucleon density approximation, the Gaussian distribution is chosen as particle distribution. This distribution function generates random number that randomizes distance between particles and a central point. The scission process is started by smashing compound nucleus central point into two parts that are left central and right central points. The yield is determined from portion of nuclei distribution which is proportional with portion of mass numbers. By using modified FTM, characteristic of particle distribution in each fission event could be formed before fission process. These characteristics could be used to make prediction about real nucleons interaction in fission process. The results of FTM calculation give information that the γγ{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}γ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} value seems as energy.},

	abstract = {A numerical scheme based on the staggered finite volume method is presented at the aim of studying surface waves generated by a bottom motion. We address the 2D Euler equations in which the vertical domain is resolved only by one layer. The resulting non-hydrostatic scheme is used to simulate surface waves generated by bottom motion in a water tank. Here we mimic Hammack experiments numerically, in which a bed section is moved upwards or downwards, resulting in transient dispersive waves. For an impulsive downward bottom thrust, free surface responds in terms of a negative leading wave, followed with dispersive train of waves. For an upward bottom thrust, amplitude of the leading wave decays as the wave propagates, and no wave of permanent form evolves— instead, there appears a train of solitons. In this article, we show that our numerical scheme can produce the correct wave profiles, comparable with the analytical and experimental results of Hammack. Simulations using intermediate and slow bottom motions are also presented. In addition, we perform a simulation of a wave generated by submerged landslide, that compares well against previous numerical simulations. Via this simulation, we demonstrate that our scheme can incorporate a moving wet–dry boundary algorithm in the run-up simulation.},

AZO and CuOx thin layers were prepared by the sol gel method, while P3HT:PCBM layer was prepared by the spin-coating method.

	abstract = {Preliminary study on influence of changing void fraction (VF) on SUPEL (Straight Utilization of sPEnt LWR fuel in LWR system) scenario for boiling water reactor (BWR) spent fuel direct recycling scheme has been carried out. Several VF values of BWR have been investigated to determine the criticality of reactor. The VF values range from 20\% to 60\%. The fraction of spent fuel to the total loaded fuel was changed from 5\% to 20\%. The required uranium enrichment for criticality becomes higher with the increasing of VF as well as the enlarging of the fraction of spent fuel in loaded fuel. The neutron spectra become harder with the augmenting of VF. The plutonium and minor actinides isotopes are produced more in the reactor.},

The νas (COO−) of citrate exhibits a high-frequency shift resulting from the formation of a unidentate coordination on AuNPs, whereas this vibration exhibits a low-frequency shift as a result of ionic bond formation on AgNPs, as predicted from the MO calculations of the corresponding metal complex salts. The enhancement in the IR signals when their vibration direction was perpendicular to the nanoparticle surface revealed the influence of localized surface plasmons excited on the metal nanoparticles.},

In many cases, the use of PGE often reduces its photovoltaic performance due to the decrease in its ionic mobility. However, such influence was not observed in our present work. In this work, the fabricated DSSC do not exhibit significant degradation in its working performance. The best overall energy conversion efficiency is about 5.25\%, as indicated by short circuit photocurrent (J$_{\textrm{sc}}$) larger than 12 mA/cm², which is comparable to performance of reference cell made by using ionic liquid only. We found from the impedance spectroscopy measurements that the electrolyte diffusion coefficient in the DSSC using this PGE is comparable to that in DSSC using ionic liquid electrolyte.},

dominate by 2pz

In the section that describes the surface of sea, Neumann boundary condition is imposed in part related to the ship and the Dirichlet boundary condition for others. Then on the other three boundaries, we imposed the Neumann boundary condition by assuming that the water does not flow on the bottom, and both end. The model is solved by numerical solution using the finite element method. Velocity potential solution on the whole domain is demonstrated as a result of the implementation of the finite element method. In this paper, we initiate an investigation with assuming that the ship is on the water so that the domain of the Laplace equation is rectangular. Then we assume the drift ship. Furthermore, we also study the dependence of width and depth of the domain to the velocity potential.},

There are parameters required in this model which give connections between two variables or between two derivative functions. In this paper we simulate the model for several parameters values. We do bifurcation analysis on the dynamics of the system in order to identify the appropriate parameters that control the stability behaviour of the system. The result shows that the system will have a limit cycle for small value of interest rate of loan, so the deposit and loan volumes are fluctuating and oscillating extremely. If the interest rate of loan is too high, the loan volume will be decreasing and vanish and the system will converge to its carrying capacity.},

Methods that have evolved are based on theoretical or empirical formulas relating hydrograph peak discharge and timing to watershed characteristics.

In this paper, a gamma probability density function and its variant are used as mathematical approximations of a unit hydrograph for Citarum Watershed. The model is adjusted with real field condition by translation and scaling. Optimal parameters are determined by using Particle Swarm Optimization method with weighted objective function.

The MC code system (especially DOSXYZnrc) has been used to investigate the different voxel (volume elements) sizes effect on the accuracy of dose distributions. To investigate this effect on dosimetry parameters, calculations were made with three different voxel sizes. The effects were investigated with dose distribution calculations for seven voxel sizes: 1 × 1 × 0.1 cm3, 1 × 1 × 0.5 cm3, and 1 × 1 × 0.8 cm3. The 1 × 109 histories were simulated in order to get statistical uncertainties of 2\%. This simulation takes about 9-10 hours to complete. Measurements are made with field sizes 10 × 10 cm2 for the 6 MV photon beams with Gaussian intensity distribution FWHM 0.1 cm and SSD 100.1 cm. MC simulated and measured dose distributions in a water phantom. The output of this simulation i.e. the percent depth dose and dose profile in dmax from the three sets of calculations are presented and comparisons are made with the experiment data from TTSH (Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore) in 0-5 cm depth. Dose that scored in voxels is a volume averaged estimate of the dose at the center of a voxel. The results in this study show that the difference between Monte Carlo simulation and experiment data depend on the voxel size both for percent depth dose (PDD) and profile dose. PDD scan on Z axis (depth) of water phantom, the big difference obtain in the voxel size 1 × 1 × 0.8 cm3 about 17\%. In this study, the profile dose focused on high gradient dose area. Profile dose scan on Y axis and the big difference get in the voxel size 1 × 1 × 0.1 cm3 about 12\%. This study demonstrated that the arrange voxel in Monte Carlo simulation becomes important.},

	abstract = {New noise reduction method for reducing dose of CT scans has been proposed. The new method is expected to address the major problems in the noise reduction algorithm, i.e. the decreasing in the spatial resolution of the image. The proposed method was developed by combining adaptive Wiener filtering and edge detection algorithms. The first step, the image was filtered with a Wiener filter. Separately, edge detection operation performed on the original image using the Prewitt method. The next step, a new image was generated based on the edge detection operation. At the edge area, the image was taken from the original image, while at the non-edge area, the image was taken from the image that had been filtered with a Wiener filter. The new method was tested on a CT image of the spatial resolution phantom, which was scanned by different current-time multiplication, namely 80, 130 and 200 mAs, while other exposure factors were kept in constant conditions. The spatial resolution phantom consists of six sets of bar pattern made of plexi-glass and separated at some distance by water. The new image quality assessed from the amount of noise and the magnitude of spatial resolution. Noise was calculated by determining the standard deviation of the homogeneous regions, while the spatial resolution was assessed by observation of the area sets of the bar pattern. In addition, to evaluate the performance of this new method has also been tested on patient CT images. From the measurements, the new method can reduce the noise to an average 64.85\%, with a spatial resolution does not decrease significantly. Visually, the third set bar on the image phantom (the distance between the bar 1.0 mm) can still be distinguished, as well as on the original image. Meanwhile, if the image is only processed using Wiener filter, the second set bar (the distance between the bar 1.3 mm) are distinguishable. Testing this new method to patient image, its results in relatively the same. Thus, using this new method, it provides the potential for dose reduction more than 60\%.},

Monte Carlo simulation for this commissioning head LINAC divided in two stages are design head Linac model using BEAMnrc, characterize this model using BEAMDP and analyze the difference between simulation and measurement data using DOSXYZnrc. In the first step, to reduce simulation time, a virtual treatment head LINAC was built in two parts (patient-dependent component and patient-independent component). The incident electron energy varied 6.1 MeV, 6.2 MeV and 6.3 MeV, 6.4 MeV, and 6.6 MeV and the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of source is 1 mm. Phase-space file from the virtual model characterized using BEAMDP. The results of MC calculations using DOSXYZnrc in water phantom are percent depth doses (PDDs) and beam profiles at depths 10 cm were compared with measurements. This process has been completed if the dose difference of measured and calculated relative depth-dose data along the central-axis and dose profile at depths 10 cm is ≤ 5\%. The effect of beam width on percentage depth doses and beam profiles was studied. Results of the virtual model were in close agreement with measurements in incident energy electron 6.4 MeV. Our results showed that photon beam width could be tuned using large field beam profile at the depth of maximum dose. The Monte Carlo model developed in this study accurately represents the Varian Clinac iX with millennium MLC 120 leaf and can be used for reliable patient dose calculations.

This study aims to investigate Prism TPS which been applied to the dose distribution of brachytherapy by taking into account the effect of source position and inhomogeneities. The results will be applicable for clinical Treatment Planning System.
Dose calculation has been implemented for water phantom and CT scan images of breast cancer using point source and line source. This study used point source and line source and divided into two cases. On the first case, Ir-192 seed source is located at the center of treatment volume. On the second case, the source position is gradually changed. The dose calculation of every case performed on a homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantom with dimension 20 × 20 × 20 cm3. The inhomogeneous phantom has inhomogeneities volume 2 × 2 × 2 cm3. The results of dose calculations using PRISM TPS were compared to literature data.
From the calculation of PRISM TPS, dose rates show good agreement with Plato TPS and other study as published by Ramdhani. No deviations greater than ±4\% for all case. Dose calculation in inhomogeneous and homogenous cases show similar result. This results indicate that Prism TPS is good in dose calculation of brachytherapy but not sensitive for inhomogeneities. Thus, the dose calculation parameters developed in this study were found to be applicable for clinical treatment planning of brachytherapy.},

The number of marbles represents the number of nucleons, A. This toy nucleus is able to imitate the real nucleus properties. In this research, the toy nucleons are only influenced by central force. A heavy toy nucleus induced by a toy nucleon will be split into two fragments. These two fission fragments are called fission yield. In this research, energy entanglement is neglected. Fission process in toy model is illustrated by two Gaussian curves intersecting each other. There are five Gaussian parameters used in this research. They are scission point of the two curves (Rc), mean of left curve (μL) and mean of right curve (μR), deviation of left curve (σL) and deviation of right curve (σR). The fission yields distribution is analyses based on Monte Carlo simulation. The result shows that variation in σ or µ can significanly move the average frequency of asymmetry fission yields. This also varies the range of fission yields distribution probability. In addition, variation in iteration coefficient only change the frequency of fission yields. Monte Carlo simulation for fission yield calculation using toy model successfully indicates the same tendency with experiment results, where average of light fission yield is in the range of 90{\textless}A{\textless}100 and average of heavy fission yield is in about 135{\textless}A{\textless}145.},

Large extreme space and geophysical events (high magnitude earthquakes, explosive volcanic eruptions, magnetic storms, etc.) are hazards for humankind, infrastructure, economies, technology and the activities of civilization. With a growing world population, and with modern reliance on delicate technological systems, human society is becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural hazardous events. The big question arises to the relation between solar forcing energy to the Earth’s global seismic activities.

The primaries move in nearly circular and elliptic orbits with respect to their center of masses. We describe, in general, motions of the circumbinary planets in RTBP under radiating primaries.

The long-term availability of meteorological satellite data is obviously useful to obtain the general trends of the corresponding parameter.

Results of long-term dynamical study of NEAs can be more significant if the Yarkovsky thermal effects are included, meaning that this needs the physical properties. To overcome this problem, here we propose a scheme to estimate unknown physical properties of NEAs, i.e. albedo, size, rotation period, pole orientation, bulk and surface densities, thermal conductivity, thermal capacity, and infrared emissivity. The scheme is started with the known absolute magnitudes and the known taxonomy classes of NEAs. Albedos are derived from the taxonomy classes, and eventually sizes can be determined. The sizes provide rotation periods and pole orientations using recent published results. Finally, by modeling some types of asteroid surfaces, the rest properties can be obtained. The scheme is used to provide the estimated physical properties of more than ten thousands NEAs representing their general picture needed for global dynamical study.},

Due to this condition, detail events in the Sun can possibly observable. For example, flare, prominence, granulation and other features can be seen easily compared to other stars. In other word the observational data can be obtained easily. And for better understanding, computational simulation is needed too. In this paper we use ZEUS-MP, a numerical code for the simulation of fluid dynamical flows in astrophysics, to study granulation and blast wave in the Sun. ZEUS-MP allows users to use hydrodynamic (HD) or magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations singly or in concert, in one, two, or three space dimensions. For granulation case, we assume that there is no influence from magnetic field. So, it’s enough to just use HD simulations. Physical parameters were analyzed for this case is velocity and density. The result shows that velocity as time function indicated more complex pattern than density. For blast wave case, we use it to study one of the Sun energetic event namely Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). In this case, we cannot ignore influence from magnetic field. So we use MHD simulations. Physical parameters were analyzed for this case is velocity and energy. The result shows more complex pattern for both parameters. It is shown too as if they have opposite pattern.

In the second year, BIMA project began to combine its time of minimum data with other previous observations to analyze O-C (Observed-Calculated) Diagram of all observed systems. The O-C diagram is one of indispensable tools to study evolution in eclipsing binaries in which it indicates period change or correction for periode prediction. Period changes closely related to evolutionary phase of the systems can be detected. In this paper, we present and discuss preliminary analysis of O-C diagram from one particular eclipsing binary system, V566 Oph.},

The classical study (with the primaries are point mass) suggests that the equilibrium points may cause the velocity of infinitesimal object relatively becomes zero and reveals the zero velocity curve. We study the motion of infinitesimal object near triangular equilibrium point (L4) and determine its zero velocity curve. We extend the study by taking into account the effects of radiation of the bigger primary (q1 ≠ 1, q2 = 1) and oblateness of the smaller primary (A1 = 0, A2 ≠ 0). The location of L4 is analytically derived then the stability of L4 and its zero velocity curves are studied numerically. Our study suggests that the oblateness and the radiation of primaries may affect the stability and zero velocity curve around L4.},

	abstract = {Accurate and detailed three-dimensional (3D) maps of Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) are still lacking. One way to obtain such 3D descriptions is to record a large set of individual absorption or reddening measurements toward target stars located at various known distances and directions. The inversion of these measurements using a tomographic method can produce spatial distribution of the ISM. Until recently absorption data were very limited and distances to the target stars are still uncertain, but the situation will greatly improve thanks to current and future massive stellar surveys from ground, and to Gaia mission. To prepare absorption data for inversion from a huge number of stellar spectra, automated tools are needed. We have developed various spectral analysis tools adapted to different type of spectra, early- or late- type star. We also have used diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) to trace IS structures and kinematics. Although we do not know yet their carriers, they can be a promising tool to trace distant interstellar clouds or Galactic arms. We present some examples of the interstellar fitting and show the potentiality of DIBs in tracing the ISM. We will also briefly show and comment the latest 3D map of the local ISM which reveal nearby cloud complexes and cavities.},

	abstract = {Extraordinary mudflow has happened in Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia since 2006. This mud comes from the giant crater that is located close to the BJP - 01. Thousands of homes have been submerged due to mudflow. Till today this giant mud crater is still has great strength despite the mud flowing over 8 years. This is a very rare phenomenon in the world. This mud flow mechanism raises big questions, because it has been going on for years, naturally the mudflow will stop by itself because the pressure should be reduced. This research evaluates all aspects of integrated observations, laboratory tests and field observations since the beginning of this ongoing mudflow. Laboratory tests were done by providing hot air bubbles into the fluid inside the inverted funnel showed that the fluid can flow with a high altitude. It is due to the mechanism of buoyant force from air bubbles to the water where the contrast density of the water and the air is quite large. Quantity of air bubbles provides direct effect to the debit of fluid flow. Direct observation in the field, in 2006 and 2007, with TIMNAS and LPPM ITB showed the large number of air bubbles on the surface of the mud craters. Temperature observation on the surface of mud crater is around 98 degree C whereas at greater depth shows the temperature is increasingly rising. This strengthens the hypothesis or proves that the mud pumping mechanism comes from buoyant force of hot air bubbles. Inversion gravity images show that the deep subsurface of main crater is close to volcanic layers or root of Arjuna mountain. Based on the simulation laboratory and field observation data, it can be concluded that the geothermal factor plays a key role in the mudflow mechanism.},

	abstract = {Three computer models of a sandstone were generated using grain based model. The porosity and the grain radius of the models were made to match the real sample, which is a sandstone obtained from Ngrayong formation. The models were produced using an algorithm to ensure the grains were consolidated. The three models have different grain shapes, which are spherical, ellipsoidal and non-spherical (polygonal). Digital image analysis were performed to the three models in order to characterize the features of the models. The porosity is set on the value ∼21\%. Despite the fact that the porosity and grain size (as well as the distribution) of the models are set to have very similar value, the produced models reveal different pore structure features. From the 2D and 3D fractal dimensions, the ellipsoidal model has the highest value among other models (the spherical and polygonal have very similar value) which indicates that the ellipsoidal model has more complex pore structure. This is confirmed by the degree of anisotropy (DA), where the ellipsoidal model has DA of 2.66 while the spherical is of 1.10 and the polygonal is of 1.46. The average of the structure separation of the models, which basically a rough estimate of the pore size reveals that the ellipsoidal model has narrower pore size compared two other models, which have very similar result. The average structure thickness of the models, which basically a rough estimate of the grain size shows that the ellipsoidal model has smallest value compared to the other two models, which once again, have very similar result. Here we conclude that the ellipsoidal model has the most complex and anisotropic pore structure compared to the two other models. Future work are focused on analyzing the effect of the grain size to other physical properties such as permeability, tortuosity and the elastic properties.},

	abstract = {The presence of closed pore in porous rock provide various effect with regard to its structural, elastic and flow properties. Physical based approach to measure porosity such as mercury porosimetry injection is unable to locate closed pore inside porous rock even though it is still possible to quantify the closed porosity. Digital data of porous rock in the form of three dimensional image can now be obtained by means of several methods such as micro-CT scan. Using the digital data, closed pore can be identified and isolated using digital rock physics approach. We first construct a synthetic three dimensional porous sample which consist of two simple side-to-side connected pore (cylinder and box shaped) and two spherical isolated pore which has closed porosity of 1.41 \%. The digital image analysis which implemented in software CTAn (Bruker Micro-CT) still produce error of 0.04\% which is very low. However, analysis using Lattice Boltzmann Method based simulation of fluid flow provide exact match to the closed porosity of the synthetic sample. Nevertheless, there are two disadvantages of this method, i.e., the simulation could take hours compared to the digital image analysis which only took several minutes and the limitation of numerical definition of zero velocity. Thus we apply both methods in order to overcome the drawbacks of each methods to analyze the digital sample of Fontainebleau sandstone. Using CTAn, we obtained the closed porosity of 0.02891845 \% and using the LBM based fluid flow simulation of 0.028948346 \%. The closed pore can then be isolated to further calculate the surface area. The result also confirmed that pore space of Fontainebleau sandstone is well connected.},

Cellulose acetate is used as an additive to increase ionic conductivity and mechanical property of polymer electrolyte membranes. The increase the percentage of cellulose acetate in membranes do not directly effect on the ionic conductivity, and the highest ionic conductivity of membranes about 5,7 × 10−4 S/cm was observed in SA/PEO/LiClO4 membrane with cellulose ratio of 10-25\% (w/w). Cellulose acetate in membranes increases mechanical strength of polymer electrolyte membranes. Based on TGA analysis, this polymer electrolyte thermally is stable until 270 °C. The polymer electrolyte membrane prepared by blending the cellulose acetate, poly(ethylene oxide), and lithium chlorate could be potentially used as a polymer electrolyte for lithium ion battery application.},

ABAQUS finite element analysis software is used to simulate bonding behavior in term of friction coefficient between fiber and matrix of aligned continuous fiber composite. Simulation result shows that Young modulus of the composite increases linearly with the increase of friction coefficient between matrix and fiber. This shows that if the value of Young's modulus of the fiber is far greater than the Young's modulus of the matrix, then the value of Young's modulus of the resulting composite will tend to get closer to the value of Young's modulus of the fiber. It means that the influence of coefficient of friction between the fiber and the matrix is getting insignificant.},

	abstract = {Cobalt stearate is an oxidant additives that can initiate a process of degradation in high density polyethylene (HDPE). To determine the effect of cobalt stearate in HDPE, oxo-biodegradable polyethylene film was given an irradiation with UV light or heating at various temperature. After given a heating, the FTIR spectra showed a new absorption peak at wave number 1712 cm−1 indicating the presence of carbonyl groups in polymers, whereas after irradiation with UV light is not visible the presence of this absorption peak. The increase concentration of cobalt stearate added in HDPE and the higher heating temperature, the intensity of the absorption peak of the carbonyl group increased. The increasing intensity of the carbonyl group absorption is caused the presence of damage in the film surface after heating, and this result is supported by analysis the surface properties of the film with using SEM. Biodegradation tests were performed on oxo-biodegradable polyethylene film which has been given heating or UV light with using activated sludge under optimal conditions the growth of microorganisms. After biodegradation, the maximum weight decreased by 23\% in the oxo-biodegradable polyethylene film with a cobalt stearate concentration of 0.2\% and after heating at a temperature of 75 °C for 10 days, and only 0.69\% in the same film after irradiation UV light for 10 days. Based on the results above, cobalt stearate additive is more effective to initiate the oxidative degradation of HDPE when it is initiated by heating compared to irradiation with UV light.},

Here, absorption coefficient has been extracted from SE measurements at photon incident angle of 70° for different Ta concentration (0.01, 0.4, and 5 at. \%). Multilayer modelling is performed which takes into account reflections at each interface through Fresnel coefficients to obtain reasonably well the fitting of Ψ and Δ data simultaneously. As the results, we estimate that film thickness increases by increasing Ta concentration accompanied by the formation of a new electronic structure. By increasing Ta impurities, the blueshift of absorption coefficient (α) peaks is observable. This result indicates that TiO2 thin film becomes optically resistive by introducing Ta doping. Schematic model of interband transition inTiO2:Ta will be proposed base on obtained optical properties.

SEM images confirm the columnar structure of the TiO2:Co layer on Si (100). Concentration of the Co dopant has been defined by means of the energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectra. Co concentrations are varied at 0.18, 0.33, and 0.68 at. \% using pure TiO2 as the reference. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra show that the TiO2:Co layer have a rutile phase. Further analysis of this structure has been performed by using room temperature spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements in the energy range of 0.5 - 6.5 eV. This optical response shows the unique feature of significantly high density fringe especially below the band gap energy region (lower than 3.3 eV) in contrast to the conventional TiO2 thin film structure. This unique feature is interpreted as a dominant contribution of the vertical interfaces at columnar boundaries towards reflected light from the sample. The evolution of Ψ and Δ will be discussed as the function of Co concentration and some optical properties will be extracted after reasonably well data fitting by multilayer modelling. Furthermore, by comparing the SE data from different measurement orientations, it has been shown that TiO2:Co tends to be anisotropic.

The reaction was performed by variations of three parameters namely the mole of reagents, the amount and type of solid support (alumina/Al2O3), and the reaction conditions. Experimental results showed that neutral-alumina was a better solid support than basic-alumina. The optimum temperature for the reaction was approximately at 125-133 °C with reaction time of 15 minutes and microwave reactor power at 500-600 W. The separation of the yellowish green product solution with preparative Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) method using n-hexane:ethyl acetate = 4:1 (v/v) as eluent yielded two fractions (I and II) and both fractions can undergo fluorescence under 365 nm UV light. Based on the LC chromatogram with methanol:water = 95:5 (v/v) as eluent and its corresponding mass spectra (ESI+), fraction I contained three compounds, which were tetracarbazole A, triphenylamine, and impurities in the form of plasticizer such as bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Fraction II also contained three compounds, which were tetracarbazole C, tetraphenylhydrazine, and plasticizer such as bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Both FT-IR (KBr disks) and NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) spectra of fraction I and II confirmed the aromatic amine groups in those compounds. The observed fluorescence colors of fraction I and II were violet and violet-blue, respectively. Based on their structures and fluorescence characters, the compounds in fraction I and II have the potential to be used as Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) compound precursors.},

In ideal fusion reactor the fuel is purely deuterium, but it need higher temperature of reactor. In ITER project the fuels are deuterium and tritium which need lower temperature of the reactor. In this study tritium for fusion reactor can be produced by using reaction of lithium with neutron in the blanket region. With the tritium breeding blanket which react between Li-6 in the blanket with neutron resulted from the plasma region. In this research the material used in each layer surrounding the plasma in the reactor is optimized. Moreover, achieving self-sufficiency condition in the reactor in order tritium has enough availability to be consumed for a long time. In order to optimize Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) value in the fusion reactor, there are several strategies considered here. The first requirement is making variation in Li-6 enrichment to be 60\%, 70\%, and 90\%. But, the result of that condition can not reach TBR value better than with no enrichment. Because there is reduction of Li-7 percent when increasing Li-6 percent. The other way is converting neutron multiplier material with Pb. From this, we get TBR value better with the Be as neutron multiplier. Beside of TBR value, fusion reactor can analyze the distribution of neutron flux and dose rate of neutron to know the change of neutron concentration for each layer in reactor. From the simulation in this study, 97\% neutron concentration can be absorbed by material in reactor, so it is good enough. In addition, it is required to analyze spectrum neutron energy in many layers in the fusion reactor such as in blanket, coolant, and divertor. Actually material in that layer can resist in high temperature and high pressure condition for more than ten years.},

This is used in the case that the natural pressure from the reservoir has significantly decreased. Sucker rod beam pumping is a method of artificial lift. Sucker rod beam pump is modeled in this research as a function of geometry of the surface part, the size of sucker rod string, and fluid properties. Besides its length, sucker rod string also classified into tapered and un-tapered. At the beginning of this research, for easy modeling, the sucker rod string was assumed as un-tapered. The assumption proved non-realistic to use. Therefore, the tapered sucker rod string modeling needs building. The numerical solution of this sucker rod beam pump model is computed using finite difference method. The numerical result shows that the peak of polished rod load for sucker rod beam pump unit C-456-D-256-120, for non-tapered sucker rod string is 38504.2 lb, while for tapered rod string is 25723.3 lb. For that reason, to avoid the sucker rod string breaks due to the overload, the use of tapered sucker rod beam string is suggested in this research.},

We introduce a complex network analysis to compare conventional and Islamic stock market in Indonesia. Additionally, Random Matrix Theory (RMT) has been added as a part of reference to expand the analysis of the result. Both of them are based on the cross correlation matrix of logarithmic price returns. Closing price data, which is taken from June 2011 to July 2012, is used to construct logarithmic price returns. We also introduce the threshold value using winner-take-all approach to obtain scale-free property of the network. This means that the nodes of the network that has a cross correlation coefficient below the threshold value should not be connected with an edge. As a result, we obtain 0.5 as the threshold value for all of the stock market. From the RMT analysis, we found that there is only market wide effect on both stock market and no clustering effect has been found yet. From the network analysis, both of stock market networks are dominated by the mining sector. The length of time series of closing price data must be expanded to get more valuable results, even different behaviors of the system.},

One of the strategy is by using metagenomic approach to amplify the gene directly from environmental sample. This research was focused on amplification of lipase gene fragment directly from the thermogenic phase of domestic waste composting in aerated trenches. We used domestic waste compost from waste treatment at SABUGA, ITB for the sample. Total chromosomal DNA were directly extracted from several stages at thermogenic phase of compost. The DNA was then directly used as a template for amplification of thermostable lipase gene fragments using a set of internal primers namely Flip-1a and Rlip-1a that has been affixed with a GC clamp in reverse primer. The results showed that the primers amplified the gene from four stages of thermogenic phase with the size of lipase gene fragment of approximately 570 base pairs (bp). These results were further used for Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis to determine diversity of thermostable lipase gene fragments.},

Simulation results show that the normal regulation of blood glucose concentration depends on insulin and glucagon concentrations. On type 1 diabetic case, the role of insulin on regulating blood glucose is not optimal because of the destruction of β cells in pancreas. These β cells destructions cause hyperglycemic episode affecting the whole body metabolism. To get over this, type 1 diabetic patients need insulin therapy to control the blood glucose level. This research has been done by using rapid acting insulin (lispro), long-acting insulin (glargine) and the combination between them to know the effects of insulin therapy on blood glucose, insulin and glucagon concentrations. Simulation results show that these different types of insulin have different effects on blood glucose concentration. Insulin therapy using lispro shows better blood glucose control after consumption of meals. Glargin gives better blood glucose control between meals and during sleep. Combination between lispro and glargine shows better glycemic control for whole day blood glucose level.},

The neutronic analysis results show that mixed nitride fuel have k-inf greater than uranium nitride fuel. It is caused by the addition of Pu-239 in mixed nitride fuel. In fuel fraction analysis, for uranium nitride fuel, the optimum volume fractions are 45\% fuel fraction, 10\% cladding and 45\% moderator. In case of UN-PuN fuel, the optimum volume fractions are 30\% fuel fraction, 10\% cladding and 60\% coolant/ moderator. The addition of Pa-231 as burnable poison for UN fuel, enrichment U-235 5\%, with Pa-231 1.6\% has k-inf more than one and excess reactivity of 14.45\%. And for mixed nitride fuel, the lowest value of reactivity swing is when enrichment (U-235+Pu) 8\% with Pa-231 0.4\%, the excess reactivity value 13,76\%. The fuel pin analyze for the addition of Americium, the excess reactivity value is lower than before, because Americium absorb the neutron. For UN fuel, enrichment U-235 8\%, Pa-231 1.6\% and Am 0.5\%, the excess reactivity is 4.86\%. And for mixed nitride fuel, when enrichment (U-235+Pu) 13\%, Pa-231 0.4\% and Am 0.1\%, the excess reactivity is 11.94\%. For core configuration, it is better to use heterogeneous than homogeneous core configuration, because the radial power distribution is better.},

This scheme introducing discrete region, the fuel is initially put in region 1, after one cycle of 10 years of burn up it is shifted to region 2 and region 1 is filled by fresh natural uranium fuel. The reactor is designed for 100 years with 10 regions arranged axially. The results of neutronic calculation showed that the void coefficients ranged from −0.6695443 \% at BOC to −0.5273626 \% at EOC for 500 MWt reactor.

The aluminas applied as support were alumina synthesized through hydrothermal process, alumina formed by pretreatment of catapal and commercial alumina which named as Ahy, Aca, and Aco respectively. Ahy has uniform morphology of nanotubes while Aca and Aco showed non-uniform morphology of particle lumps. The particle lumps of Aca were larger than those of Aco. Ahy, Aca, and Aco respectively has average pore diameter of 2.75, 2.86 and 2.9 nm. Metals were deposited on the supports by incipient-wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, H2-TPR, and H2 chemisorption. Catalyst acitivity test for Fischer-Tropsch reaction was carried out in a micro reactor at 200 °C and 1 atm, and molar ratio of H2/CO = 2:1. The metal oxide particle size increased in the order M/Aco {\textless} M/Aca {\textless} M/Ahy. The catalysts reducibility also increased according to the order M/Aco {\textless} M/Aca {\textless} M/Ahy suggesting that the larger metal oxide particles are more reducible. The number of active site was not proportional to the reducibility because during the reduction, larger metal oxide particles were converted into larger metal particles. On the other hand, the number of active sites was inversely proportional to the particle sizes. The number of active site increased in the order M/Ahy {\textless} M/Aco {\textless} M/Aca. The catalytic activity also increased in the following order M/Ahy {\textless} M/Aco {\textless} M/Aca. The activity per active site increased according to the order M/Aca {\textless} M/Aco {\textless} M/Ahy meaning that for M/Ahy, a little increase in active site will lead to a significance increase in catalytic activity. It showed that Ahy has potential for the better support.},

The greater the total mass flow rate, the smaller the outlet temperature, but increase the pressure drop so that the chimney needed more higher to achieve natural circulation or condition of the system does not require a pump.

	abstract = {Accurate modeling and estimation of impedance functions is essential for the correct interpretation of Controlled Source Audio Magnetotelluric (CSAMT) measurements. Non plane wave effect of CSAMT source and noises are inevitably encountered when CSAMT observations are conducted and, consequently, impedance estimates are usually based on least-squares (LS) approximation, and the resulting estimates need to be corrected for the non plane wave field fraction. However, estimation procedure based on LS would not be statistically optimal, as outliers (abnormal data) are frequently superimposed on a normal ambient CSAMT noise field. In this situation, the estimation can be seriously misleading, while plane wave correction has also limited application, as the non plane wave field fraction is reasonably strong. This paper briefly discus the recent development of alternative methods for the CSAMT impedance modeling and its estimation, those are efficient in nature. The means for accomplishing the non plane wave problem is based on full solution numerical modeling of CSAMT impedance function that accommodates the non plane wave effect in the function. Whilst, one appealing approach to dealing with outliers is to make the estimation procedure robust. This is based on the M-estimation and the Hilbert transform operating on the causal CSAMT impedance functions. As demonstrated, the full solution based modeling for CSAMT impedance function is applied for all measurement zones, including near-, transition- as well as the far-field zones, and suitably, the plane wave correction is no longer needed for the impedance function. In the resulting impedance estimates, outlier contamination is removed and the self consistency between the real and imaginary parts of the impedance estimates is guaranteed. Using synthetic data, it is shown that the proposed methods can produce usable CSAMT impedance functions for all measurement zones, even under condition of severe noise contamination.},

Carbon deposition rate is higher as confirmed by AFM results if the silicon substrate is treated by HF solution. EDAX characterization results tell that silicon (111) substrate with HF treatment have more carbon fraction than substrate without treatment. These results confirmed that HF treatment on silicon Si (111) substrates could enhance the carbon deposition by using DC sputtering. Afterward, the carbon atomic arrangement on silicon (111) surface is studied by performing thermal annealing process to 900 °C.

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the electron transmittance and tunneling current in high-k-based-MOS capacitors with trapping charge by including the off-diagonal effective-mass tensor elements and the effect of coupling between transverse and longitudinal energies represented by an electron velocity in the gate. The HfSiOxN/SiO2 dual ultrathin layer is used as the gate oxide in an n+ poly- Si/oxide/Si capacitor to replace SiO2. The main problem of using HfSiOxN is the charge trapping formed at the HfSiOxN/SiO2 interface that can influence the performance of the device. Therefore, it is important to develop a model taking into account the presence of electron traps at the HfSiOxN/SiO2 interface in the electron transmittance and tunneling current. The transmittance and tunneling current in n+ poly- Si/HfSiOxN/trap/SiO2/Si(100) capacitors are calculated by using Airy wavefunctions and a transfer matrix method (TMM) as analytical and numerical approaches, respectively. The transmittance and tunneling current obtained from the Airy wavefunction are compared to those computed by the TMM. The effects of the electron velocity on the transmittance and tunneling current are also discussed.},

One of polymer that can produce the greatest piezoelectric properties is poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Piezoelectric properties of PVDF can be improved by mechanical treatment on the varying film thickness and the temperature. PVDF film has produced by roll hot press tool. Furthermore, PVDF films were characterized by XRD, IR and I-V meter. We have been obtained an increase piezoelectric properties of PVDF films that characterized by increasing β fraction. We get β fraction was 63.63\%, 66.35\% and 71.60\% for temperatures of 140, 150 and 160°C, respectively at film thickness of 13 µm. In addition, We have gained β fraction for the thickness of 15, 13 and 8 µm are 64.60\%, 66.35\% and 69.00\%, respectively at temperature of 140°C. This is due to the increasing temperature and decreasing film thickness then more dipoles are oriented in PVDF films. These results indicate that mechanical treatment caused difference film thickness and temperature of PVDF film has a strong influence on the piezoelectric properties.},

The point cloud collection process was performed by moving two ultrasonic sensors in y and x directions. Both sensors measure a distance from an object surface to a reference point of each sensor. The measurement results represent the point cloud of object surface and the data will be sent to computer via RF module. The point cloud then converted to 3D model using MATLAB.

After rotating one rotation, the sensor sends one pulse and the number of pulses are counted for a certain time of counting. The measurement data, i.e. the number of pulses per unit time, are converted into water flow velocity (m/s) through a mathematical formula. The microcontroller counts the pulse sent by the sensor and the number of counted pulses are stored into the EEPROM memory. The time interval for counting is provided by the RTC and can be set by the operator. The instrument was tested under various time intervals ranging from 10 to 40 seconds and several standard propellers owned by Experimental Station for Hydraulic Structure and Geotechnics (BHGK), Research Institute for Water Resources (Pusair).

In this paper, we present the development of AC power source for CSEM transmitter. As the power source we used AC source with sine wave signal. To satisfy a high power and high voltage in the equipment, we used the full-bridge configuration switching. It works on 990 Hz maximum frequency, and can deliver maximum current of 1.9 A at 620 V. The switching is controlled by microcontroller using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and the driver of inverter is built using IGBT. The output frequency can be varied from 1 Hz to 990 Hz. For varied frequencies the harmonic distortion is different due to switching speed. As frequency increase the harmonic distortion also increase. We found that the total harmonic distortion can be reduced to 1 \% at the output with 330 Hz.},

This method is more convenient because it is more accurate than other methods of seismic recorders. To improve the quality of the results of seismic measurements, the signal needs to be amplified to obtain better subsurface images. The purpose of this study is to improve the accuracy of measurement by amplifying the input signal. We use seismic sensors/geophones with a frequency of 4.5 Hz. The signal is amplified by means of 12 units of non-inverting amplifier. The non-inverting amplifier using IC 741 with the resistor values 1KΩ and 1MΩ. The amplification results were 1,000 times. The results of signal amplification converted into digital by using the Analog Digital Converter (ADC). Quantitative analysis in this study was performed using the software Lab VIEW 8.6. The Lab VIEW 8.6 program was used to control the ADC. The results of qualitative analysis showed that the seismic conditioning can produce a large output, so that the data obtained is better than conventional data.

Results of analysis of the geometry and Snell’s law shows that the angular position of the detector is not only determined by the angle of incidence of light alone but also by the size of the prism and the detector position from the rotation axis of goniometer. The experimental results show relation between the angle of detector and angle of goniometer. When the prism rotated 45 °, position of goniometer detector is 2×45 °. However, when the prism rotated at an angle instead of 45 °, detector position µ is not always equal to twice the rotation angle goniometer ψ, so that this relationship needs to be corrected. This correction is also determined by the value of the refractive index of the prism is used. By knowing the relationship between detector position and the incident angle of light, this formulation can be used to control the position of the sample and the detector in the experiments based on ATR.},

We also simulated the influence of QD size to capture a wider light spectrum. We present a simple calculation method with low computing power demand. Results show that the increasing in quantum dot size can increase in capturing wider spectrum of light. Arrangement InAs QD in bulk material GaAs can capture wider spectrum of light and increase the absorption coefficient. The arrangement InAs QD 2 nm in GaAs bulk can increase solar cell efficiency up to 49.68\%.},

	abstract = {Thorium has lately attracted considerable attention because it is accumulating as a by-product of large scale rare earth mining. The objective of research is to analyze transient behavior of a heavy water cooled thorium breeder that is designed by Tokai University and Tokyo Institute of Technology. That is oxide fueled, PWR type reactor with heavy water as primary coolant. An example of the optimized core has relatively small moderator to fuel volume ratio (MFR) of 0.6 and the characteristics of the core are burn-up of 67 GWd/t, breeding ratio of 1.08, burn-up reactivity loss during cycles of {\textless} 0.2\% dk/k, and negative coolant reactivity coefficient. One of the nuclear reactor accidents types examined here is Unprotected Transient over Power (UTOP) due to withdrawing of the control rod that result in the positive reactivity insertion so that the reactor power will increase rapidly. Another accident type is Unprotected Loss of Flow (ULOF) that caused by failure of coolant pumps. To analyze the reactor accidents, neutron distribution calculation in the nuclear reactor is the most important factor. The best expression for the neutron distribution is the Boltzmann transport equation. However, solving this equation is very difficult so that the space-time diffusion equation is commonly used. Usually, space-time diffusion equation is solved by employing a point kinetics approach. However, this approach is less accurate for a spatially heterogeneous nuclear reactor and the nuclear reactor with quite large reactivity input. Direct method is therefore used to solve space-time diffusion equation which consider spatial factor in detail during nuclear reactor accident simulation. Set of equations that obtained from full implicit finite-difference method is solved by using iterative methods. The indication of UTOP accident is decreasing macroscopic absorption cross-section that results large external reactivity, and ULOF accident is indicated by decreasing coolant flow. The power reactor has a peak value before reactor has new balance condition. The analysis showed that temperatures of fuel and claddings during accident are still below limitations which are in secure condition.},

The silicon atom changes the energy gap of pristine zigzag (10,0) CNT, it is 0.19 eV more narrow than that of pristine CNT. Geometrically, the silicon atom creates sp3 bond with three adjacent carbon atoms, where the tetrahedral form of its sp3 bond is consisted of free unoccupied state. The silicon atom does not induce magnetism to zigzag CNT. Due to gallium (Ga) and arsenic (As) atom substitution, the zigzag CNT becomes metallic and has magnetic moment of 1 µB. The valance and conduction band are crossed each other, then the energy gap is vanished. The electronic properties of GaAs-doped CNT are dominantly affected by gallium atom and its magnetic properties are dominantly affected by arsenic atom. These results prove that the CNT with desired properties can be obtained with substitutional impurities without any giving structural defect.},

Orbital coupling between distributions of semi major axis (a) and inclination (i) segregated at about 2 AU turns out to exhibit bump at about inclination of about 20°. This bump is emerged because of the diversity in orbital mobility of NEAs between regions of a {\textless} 2 AU and a {\textgreater} 2 AU, in which correspond to the secular and the mean-motion resonances. NEAs which located at a {\textgreater} 2 AU are dominated by the asteroids whose i {\textless} 15° and are protected by the secular resonance (υ6) of Saturn.

As the established model that the Sun’s energy fueled by the nuclear reaction, along with transport process to the typical Solar surface on around 6000-K temperature, many aspects still left as an open questions, such as how the chromosphere responded to the photospheric dynamics. In this preliminary work, we try to analyze the Solar chromosphere respond to the Photospheric dynamics using tomography study implementing multi-wavelength analysis observation obtained from Dutch Open Telescope.

	abstract = {Amplitude various offset is widely used in petroleum exploration as well as in petroleum development field. Generally, phenomenon of amplitude in various angles assumes reservoir’s layer is quite thick. It also means that the wave is assumed as a very high frequency. But, in natural condition, the seismic wave is band limited and has quite low frequency. Therefore, topic about amplitude various angles in thin layer reservoir as well as low frequency assumption is important to be considered. Thin layer reservoir means the thickness of reservoir is about or less than quarter of wavelength. In this paper, I studied about the reflection phenomena in elastic wave which considering interference from thin layer reservoir and transmission wave. I applied Zoeppritz equation for modeling reflected wave of top reservoir, reflected wave of bottom reservoir, and also transmission elastic wave of reservoir. Results show that the phenomena of AVA in thin layer reservoir are frequency dependent. Thin layer reservoir causes interference between reflected wave of top reservoir and reflected wave of bottom reservoir. These phenomena are frequently neglected, however, in real practices. Even though, the impact of inattention in interference phenomena caused by thin layer in AVA may cause inaccurate reservoir characterization. The relation between classes of AVA reservoir and reservoir’s character are different when effect of ones in thin reservoir and ones in thick reservoir are compared. In this paper, I present some AVA phenomena including its cross plot in various thin reservoir types based on some rock physics data of Indonesia.},

One of such instrument is MVM1, a new kind of magnetic viscosity meter which allow measurement of viscous magnetization to be conducted in 14 steps of time delay ranging from 10 to 100 µs. In this study, we have measured the changes of magnetic viscosity over the time delay and magnetic susceptibility in a suite of natural samples. The results show that viscous magnetization decays with time (in logarithmic scale or log t) which follows the trend of cubical-logarithmic decay. This is a unique response of fine magnetic grains, i.e. superparamagnetic grains, when that magnetization was measured in very short time delay. We then found the correlation between parameters of magnetic viscosity, S in specific range of time delay, and parameters derived from magnetic susceptibility measurements. This correlation enables the measurements of magnetic viscosity to be used in order to approximate fraction of specific size of fine magnetic grains in bulk samples.},

The environmentally friendly polymer electrolyte is required to decrease the risk of environmental pollution caused by toxic materials of battery components. Therefore, in this study was focused on the preparation of the environmentally friendly low cost polymer electrolyte membrane for lithium-ion battery applications. The preparation of polymer electrolyte membrane was done by casting of polymer solution. Polymer electrolyte membrane was prepared by mixing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and LiClO4 with various compositions, and each component of was separately dissolved in demineralized water. Polymer solution was stirred until homogeneous, the solution was then poured onto a petri dish, and the solvent was evaporated to form the film/membrane. The characterizations of polymer electrolyte membranes were carried out by using FTIR for functional group, Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) used for ionic conductivity, Autograph for mechanical strength, and Optical microscope for surfaces morphology. The optimal ionic conductivity was obtained on the membrane with PVA/PEO composition of 7/3 (w/w). By addition of PEO on the blending of LiClO4-PVA can increase the mechanical stress and modulus at break of the membranes, and the optimal mechanical stress and modulus at break of membranes were obtained in the membrane with PVA/PEO ratio of 8/2. In addition, the increase LiClO4 content in membranes can improve the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte membranes, but the mechanical strength of membranes decreases.},

It is necessary to understand the real process of infection, factors which contribute to the complication of the transmission in order to come up with a good and sound mathematical model. Although it is not easy to simulate the real transmission process of the infection, we could say that almost all models have been developed from the already long known Host-Vector model. It constitutes the main transmission processes i.e. birth, death, infection and recovery. From this simple model, the basic concepts of Disease Free and Endemic Equilibria and Basic Reproductive Ratio can be well explained and understood. Theoretical, modeling, control and treatment aspects of disease transmission problems have then been developed for various related diseases. General construction as well as specific forms of basic reproductive ratios for vector-borne diseases are discusses here.},

The model is used to calculate the intracellular fluxes in the central metabolism of the yeast cell. Optimal control is then applied to the kinetic model to find the optimal regulation for the fermentation system. The sensitivity results show that there are external and internal control parameters which are adjusted in enhancing ethanol production. As an external control parameter, glucose supply should be chosen in appropriate way such that the optimal ethanol production can be achieved. For the internal control parameter, we find three enzymes as regulation targets namely acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase, and alcohol dehydrogenase which reside in the acetaldehyde branch.

This is due to the fact that the treatment is only partially effective against macrofilaria. Simulations of the model reveals that DEC-ALB treatment does give significant reduction of acute and chronic compartments at the end of the treatment period and slow down the growth after the treatment before eventually tend to the endemic state. It showed that repeated treatment during MDA is effective to decrease the transmission.

The cellulose used in this study was obtained by isolation of corncob, followed by hydrolyzed using H2SO4 50\% at 45°C for 60 minutes. Nanocrystalline cellulose was then characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, Particle Size Analyzer (PSA), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-Ray diffraction. Based on PSA results, the nanocrystalline cellulose has an average diameter of 17,4 nm with a spherical morphology determined by SEM analysis. The analysis of X-Ray diffraction showed the crystallinity index of nanocrystalline cellulose was higher than isolated cellulose in the amount of 75\%. The Impedance Spectrometry (IE) measurement showed that the ionic conductivity of PVA/LiClO4/nanocrystalline cellulose membrane is 1.66 × 10−4 S/cm. So, nanocrystalline cellulose has a potential to be used as a nanocomposite in polymer electrolyte membranes for lithium ion battery separator.},

In the present study, we carried out structural bioinformatics analysis to estimate the structural properties of the cloned gene products. In this study, crystal structures of several proteins originated from nonhalophiles, moderate and extreme halophiles were used as references. Moderate and extreme halophilic proteins were grouped into OSMOL and SALT-IN proteins, respectively, which referred to the adaptation strategy of moderate and extreme halophiles against external osmotic pressure exerted by hypersaline solution in their habitats. All structural bioinformatics analysis presented here were carried out by evaluating the relative difference of various analysed parameters between all halophiles proteins including the references and the nonhalophiles ones. Lipase samples from the six Bledug Kuwu bacterial isolates displayed different profiles in amino acid composition, secondary structures, solvent accessible surface areas, radius of gyrations and salt bridges compare to those of all the references structures including OSMOL and SALT-IN proteins. These differences may be correlated to the unique halophiles habitat of all six bacteria isolates, which is the salty mud crater situated at the mainland and far from the sea. Therefore, based on this analysis we can expect that the biochemical and structural property of those six lipase samples were unique as well.},

	abstract = {Actinide recycling options of spent nuclear fuel are estimated to have many advantages such as reducing nuclear waste, increasing nuclear fuel utilization and improving proliferation resistance aspect of nuclear fuel. Composition of spent nuclear fuel consists of heavy nuclides and fission products including uranium and plutonium as main actinide. In addition, it is also consist of some minor actinides (MA) which can be recycled to reduce the volume and radioactive intensity of long-lived radioactive waste and in the same time to increase level of proliferation resistance. In general, some MAs can be utilized as useful material such as increasing nuclear fuel production and producing some even mass plutonium such as Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242 as a control material for protected plutonium production. In this paper, identification of even mass plutonium isotopes production for the application of fuel breeding capability and proliferation resistant aspect of isotopic plutonium production was investigated. A large fast breeder reactor (FBR) model is adopted by using 800 days operation for one cycling operation for 4 fuel batches systems for optimization and analyses. The analysis of loading MA materials into the FBR core regions shows the Pu-238 production is increasing significantly as well as additional production of other plutonium isotopes. Isotopic Plutonium production of Pu-238 as main product can be estimated from fuel conversion process of MA in the reactor. This fuel conversion phenomena of Pu-238 can be identified as fertile material for fuel breeding capability, that Pu-238 can be converted to Pu-239 by neutron capture which is similar process also for fuel conversion of Pu-240 to Pu-241 as fissile materials. In addition, isotopic production of Pu-239 from converted Pu-238 as additional fuel which can be added with some quantities of Pu-239 production from converted U-238 for extending reactor operation. Production of Pu-238 in the reactor are used for categorizing some level of protected plutonium productions which can increase isotopic barrier level of plutonium in term of decay heat (DH) as well as Pu-240 as additional even mass contributor.},

Protease in this fraction has highest activity at pH 8.0 and 55°C and its activity of protease was enhanced by the addition of several metal ions.

In the present study, we were interested to evaluate the molecular mechanism of opening RmL lid segment from its closed state in aqueous solvent by using targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) approach. The external forces about 0.125kcal/(mol.Å) was applied in TMD to push the closed state of RmL lid toward the targeted open state. The results showed that RmL lid was fail to reach the targeted structure, in which the final structure was stacked at about 65\% opening. The comparative structural analysis between the partially and fully open states revealed the caused of the sterical hindrance preventing the lid segment to reach the fully open state. Strong hydrophobic interactions among Trp88 with the surrounding non-polar residues in the active site was the major caused for the sterical hindrance. This restriction will protect the active site of the enzyme to be fully exposed to the solvent, thereby minimizing the accessibility of non-substrate molecules into the active site.},

The aim of this project is to compare the analytical perfomance results of 90 Sr betavoltaic battery to 63 Ni betavoltaic battery and the source activity influences to performance. Since it has a higher power density, 90 Sr betavoltaic battery yields more power than 63 Ni betavoltaic battery but less radiation-electricity conversion efficiency. However, beta particles emitted from 90 Sr source could travel further inside the silicon corresponding to stopping range of beta particles, thus the 90 Sr betavoltaic battery could be designed thicker than 63 Ni betavoltaic battery to achieve higher conversion efficiency.},

The original miniFUJI reactor design uses LiF-BeF 2 -ThF 4 - 233 UF 4 as a fuel salt. In the present study, the use of LiF 4 -ThF 4 -PuF 4 as fuel salt instead of LiF-BeF 2 -ThF 4 -UF 4 will be discussed. The neutronics cell calculation has been performed by using PIJ (collision probability method code) routine of SRAC 2006 code, with the nuclear data library is JENDL-4.0. The results reveal that the reactor can attain the criticality condition with the plutonium concentration in the fuel salt is equal to 9.16\% or more. The conversion ratio diminishes with the enlarging of plutonium concentration in the fuel. The neutron spectrum of miniFUJI MSR with plutonium fuel becomes harder compared to that of the 233 U fuel.},

At low rf power, deposited carbon atoms on catalyst substrate is obviously observed which is provides that even with a minimum power it still capable of resulted in carbon nanosheet but unable to enhance plasma formation therefore the properties of material absolutely need to be optimized. The fabrication process was carried out at 20 sccm of CH 4 for 20 minutes with 70 MHz/8 watt and 300 mTorr pressure. From SEM images it shows that the morphology of silver catalyst substrates determine carbon formation.

Prior deposition, powder carbon nanodots were synthesized from a mixture of commercial urea as the nitrogen sources and citric acid as a carbon source by using hydrothermal and microwave-assisted heating method. The prepared powder was dispersed in transparent epoxy resin and then coated on glass substrate. The photoluminescence result for sample with 0.035 g citric acid exhibited an intense, single, homogeneous and broad spectrum with yellowish emission upon excitation at 365 nm. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) result showed the existences of C=C, C-H, C=O, N-H and O-H functional groups which confirmed the quality of the sample. Further, based on UV-Vis measurement, the prepared thin film was highly transparent (transmittance 90\%) with estimated film thickness around 764 nm.

In this study, we investigate the application of Path Integral method in financial derivatives, stock options. Black-Scholes Model (Nobel 1997) was a beginning anchor in Option Pricing study. Though this model did not successfully predict option price perfectly, especially because its sensitivity for the major changing on market, Black-Scholes Model still is a legitimate equation in pricing an option. The derivation of Black-Scholes has a high difficulty level because it is a stochastic partial differential equation. Black-Scholes equation has a similar principle with Path Integral, where in Black-Scholes the share's initial price is transformed to its final price. The Black-Scholes propagator function then derived by introducing a modified Lagrange based on Black-Scholes equation. Furthermore, we study the correlation between path integral analytical solution and Monte-Carlo numeric solution to find the similarity between this two methods.},

A thermomagnetic rotary engine is one model of it that was designed in the form of a ferromagnetic wheel that can rotates because of magnetization change at Curie temperature. The study is aimed to describe the thermodynamic and mechanical analysis of a thermomagnetic rotary engine and calculate the efficiencies. In thermodynamic view, the ideal processes are isothermal demagnetization, adiabatic demagnetization, isothermal magnetization, and adiabatic magnetization. The values of thermodynamic efficiency depend on temperature difference between hot and cold reservoir. In mechanical view, a rotational work is determined through calculation of moment of inertia and average angular speed. The value of mechanical efficiency is calculated from ratio between rotational work and heat received by system.

	abstract = {The high rate of rainfall is the main trigger factor in many cases of landslides. However, each type of soils has unique characteristics and behavior concerning the rainfall infiltration. Therefore, early warning system of landslide will be more accurate by monitoring the changes of ground water condition. In this study, the monitoring of ground water changes was designed by using soil moisture sensor and simple microcontroller for data processing. The performance of soil moisture sensor was calibrated using the gravimetric method. To determine the soil characteristic and behavior with respect to water content that induce landslides, an experiment involving small-scale landslide model was conducted. From these experiments, the electric resistance of the soil increased as soil water content increases. The increase of soil water content led to the rise of the pore pressure and soil weight which could cause soil vulnerability to the movement. In addition, the various soil types were used to determine the responses of soils that induce the slope failure. Experimental results showed that each type of soils has different volumetric water content, soil matrix suction and shear strength of the slope. This condition influenced the slope stability that trigger of landslide.},

	abstract = {It is clear that the quality of education is directly related to the quality of teachers and the teaching methods. One of the teaching methods that can improve the quality of education is research-based learning (RBL) method. In this method, students act as the center of learning while teachers become the guides that provide direction and advice. RBL is a learning method that combines cooperative learning, problem solving, authentic learning, contextual case study and inquiry approach discovery. The main goal of this method is to construct a student that can think critically, analyze and evaluate problems, and find a new science from these problems (learning by doing). In this paper, RBL is used to improve the understanding about measurement using deflection-type Bridge that is implemented in the determination of ground water changes. In general, there are three stages that have been done. Firstly the exposure stage, then the experience stage and lastly the capstone stage. The exposure stage aims to increase the knowledge and the comprehension of student about the topic through understanding the basics concepts, reviewing the literature and others. The understanding gained in the exposure stage is being used for application and analysis at the experience stage. While the final stage is the publication of research results both verbally and in writing. Based on the steps that have been conducted, it can be showed that deflection-type Bridge can be utilized in soil moisture meter.},

	abstract = {The characteristic of Indonesian stock market is interesting especially because it represents developing countries. We investigate the dynamics and structures by using Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Here, we analyze the cross-correlation of the fluctuations of the daily closing price of stocks from the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) between January 1, 2007, and October 28, 2014. The eigenvalue distribution of the correlation matrix consists of noise which is filtered out using the random matrix as a control. The bulk of the eigenvalue distribution conforms to the random matrix, allowing the separation of random noise from original data which is the deviating eigenvalues. From the deviating eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors, we identify the intrinsic normal modes of the system and interpret their meaning based on qualitative and quantitative approach. The results show that the largest eigenvector represents the market-wide effect which has a predominantly common influence toward all stocks. The other eigenvectors represent highly correlated groups within the system. Furthermore, identification of the largest components of the eigenvectors shows the sector or background of the correlated groups. Interestingly, the result shows that there are mainly two clusters within IDX, natural and non-natural resource companies. We then decompose the correlation matrix to investigate the contribution of the correlated groups to the total correlation, and we find that IDX is still driven mainly by the market-wide effect.},

This research aims to design a mini-sized biogas plant which can be use effectively to produce the alternative energy, and also to examine the difference quality of biogas which is produced from slurry which was given starter and slurry which was not given starter. In this study, a mini-sized biogas plant has been designed, and tested for two different types of slurry. Ratio of cow dung : water : starter of the first slurry is 3 : 2 : 0.003 (The starter which was used in this study is Green Phoskko), and for the second type of slurry, ratio of cow dung : water is 3 : 2, but in this second type, the slurry was not given a starter. Cattle dung used in this study is stored in advance for one week, two weeks, and three weeks, before use. Result of this study showed that the first type of slurry produce biogas in a faster time than the second type of slurry. Also, the amount of gas obtained from the first slurry is more than the second type of slurry. It can be seen from the length of time which is takes to burn the gas produced from the first slurry much longer than the second type of slurry.},

This sandstone has unique characteristics, which is a clean-fme sandstone, composed of 99\% quartz, virtually devoid of clay, with the grain size of about 200 μm. Fontainebleau sandstone is widely used as a reference in the study of rock microstructure analysis and modelling. In this work analysis regarding the grain and pore size of Fontainebleau is presented. Calculation of 2D pore size and grain size distribution were done on the 299 slice of digital image of the Fontainebleau sandstone using Feret's diameters, equivalent diameters ( d = 4A/P ), and by means of local thickness/separation using plate model. For the 3D grain and pore size distribution, calculation of local thickness and local separation of the structure were used. Two dimensional analysis by means of Feret's diameter and equivalent diameter reveal that both grain and pore size distributions are in the form of reverse-J shaped (right skewed) while the local thickness/separation approach produces almost similar to symmetric Gaussian distribution. Three dimensional analysis produces fairly symmetric Gaussian distribution for both the grain and pore size. Further image processing were conducted and were succeed in producing three dimensional visual of the colour coded structure thickness (grain related) and structure separation (pore related).},

For SET modeling and simulation, master equation method treats the electron tunneling and its transition probabilistically. The probability of electron tunneling is used to determine the current density in accordance with selected input parameters. The calculation results show fairly accurate electrical characteristics of SET as compared with experimental data. Staircase pattern from I-V are clearly obtained as the main role of coulomb blockade effect in SET system. We also extend our calculation by introduce some additional parameters such as; the effect of working temperature, gate voltage dependent, and the influence of resistance to the device characteristic. We found that increasing operational temperature will promote higher current density, both in forward and reverse bias region. In the case of using single dot with 30 nm × 80 nm × 125 nm dimension, coulomb blockade effect could be reduced by applying gate voltage higher than 3V and setting drain resistance higher than source's. Our studies show an alternative approach in modeling and simulation of electronic devices and could be potential for development of novel nanoelectronic devices.},

Landslides are influenced by several factors such as ground slope, degree of rainfall, land cover (ground layers), and the vibration around the slopes. From these factors, tilt detection sensors and soil moisture sensor have been developed to detect landslide failure. These sensors mounted so that it can detect the occurrence of landslides. The study was conducted on a container which contains the sloping ground. Landslide, slope processes, and soil humidity were investigated in this container. MMA8451Q accelerometer was used as a tilt sensor to detect the acceleration assembled in MEMS (Micro Mechanical System) technology since it is easily available, mass- produced, inexpensive, and high-precision output data. Landslide simulator has been developed hence the process leading to landslide event can be directly analyzed without the need of real life occurrence of landslides. The simulator was made from glass with size 80 cm × 20 cm × 40 cm that was filled by soil. Based on the simulation results, there were changes on accelerometer and soil moisture data during the landslide occurrence.},

	abstract = {In this experiment, submicron bubbles that have diameters less than 1 millimeter were generated by mixing water and gas by hydrodynamic cavitation method. The water was forced to pass through a venturi tube in which the speed of the water will increase in the narrow section, the throat, of the venturi. When the speed of water increased, the pressure would drop at the throat of the venturi causing the outside air to be absorbed via the gas inlet. The gas was then trapped inside the water producing bubbles. The effects of several physical parameters on the characteristics of the bubbles will be discussed thoroughly in this paper. It was found that larger amount of gas pressure during compression will increase the production rate of bubbles and increase the density of bubble within water.},

In its flow, the fluid can experience a few of barriers / obstacles like the exsisting of things in the flow medium. The existence of the barriers can detain the rate speed of the fluid flow. The barries that its form is different will provide influence to the speed of of fluid flow that is different as well. To know the influence of barriers form twards the profile of fluid speed rate, is conducted by the simulation by using Lattice Boltzmann Methode (LBM). In this simulation, the barriers is varied in the form of circle, square, and ellips.

From the simulation, it is obtained that the barriers with square formed produced the higest speed rate of the fluid flow, with the speed rate 0.26 lu/ts, then circle formed with the speed rate 0.24 lu/ts, and the last square formed with speed rate 0.24 lu/ts.},

This paper reports the role of the type of chemical additives to PCM CaCl 2 .6H 2 O to the phase change process throughout the solidification process or heat release in order to optimize its performance as latent heat energy storage system. In this research we used several kinds of chemical additive, namely SrCl 2 .6H 2 O (1.0 wt\%), BaCO 3 (0.5 wt\%), and K 2 CO 3 (0.5 wt\%). In terms of its latent time for phase change process the order the effectiveness of those chemical additives are reduced from SrCl 2 .6H 2 O, BaCO 3 and K 2 CO 3 .

Fractal dimension was obtained from the straight regression line that interpolated the points in the interval with the largest coefficient determination. Intercept defined by the point of intersection on the -axis. The conclusion was that the distributions of peat soil density showing the fractal behaviour with the heterogeneity of the samples from the highest to the lowest were L5, L1, L4, L3 and L2.

The produced projection, images, were reconstructed using NRecon (in-house software from SkyScan). The images of urinary stones were analyzed using CT Analyser (CT An) to obtain information of the internal structure and the Hounsfield Unit (HU) value to determine the information regarding the composition of the urinary stones, respectively. The average HU values from certain region of interests in the same slice were compared with spectral curves of known materials from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). From the analysis, the composition of the six scanned stones were obtained. Two stones are composed of cystine, two are composed of struvite, two other stones are composed of struvite+cystine. In conclusion, the single energy micro CT with 80 kV can be used identifying cystine and struvite urinary stone.},

Direct field measurement was conducted using DC-resistivity Wenner-Schlumberger method on the sag pond as well as laboratory resistivity measurement of cores taken from the sag pond. Two resistivity crosssections were obtained after performing 2D inversion of the data which reveal that the resistivity distribution consist of a resistive layer (40-60 ohm.m) overlying a medium resistive layer (30-35 ohm.m). The third layer has relatively low resistivity of 16-25 ohm.m. At the intersection of these two lines we took coring samples down to depth of 5 m below surface and measured the electrical conductivity and dielectric permittivity for each 1 cm of sample using EM-50 data logger.

The coordinator collects data to each node, one a time, to prevent collision data between nodes, save data to SD Card and transmit data to web server via GPRS. Inclinometer was calibrated with self-built in calibrator and tested in high temperature environment to check the durability. The GPS was tested by displaying its position in web server via Google Map Application Protocol Interface (API v.3).

These equations are used in the case of Transverse Electric polarization (TE) and Transverse Magnetic polarization (TM). To calculate the solutions of electric and magnetic fields in the entire domain, the modeling domain is discretized into smaller elements using the finite element method, whereas the assembled matrix of equation system is solved using the Biconjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGStab) technique combined with the Incomplete Lower - Upper ( ILU ) preconditioner.

	abstract = {Well logging is important in oil and gas exploration. Many physical parameters of reservoir is derived from well logging measurement. Geophysicists often use well logging to obtain reservoir properties such as porosity, water saturation and permeability. Most of the time, the measurement of the reservoir properties are considered expensive. One of method to substitute the measurement is by conducting a prediction using artificial neural network. In this paper, artificial neural network is performed to predict porosity log data from other log data. Three well from ‘yy’ field are used to conduct the prediction experiment. The log data are sonic, gamma ray, and porosity log. One of three well is used as training data for the artificial neural network which employ the Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation algorithm. Through several trials, we devise that the most optimal input training is sonic log data and gamma ray log data with 10 hidden layer. The prediction result in well 1 has correlation of 0.92 and mean squared error of 5.67 x10 -4 . Trained network apply to other well data. The result show that correlation in well 2 and well 3 is 0.872 and 0.9077 respectively. Mean squared error in well 2 and well 3 is 11 x 10 -4 and 9.539 x 10 -4 . From the result we can conclude that sonic log and gamma ray log could be good combination for predicting porosity with neural network.},

	abstract = {Fractured rock plays important role in reservoir production. In larger scale, fractures are more likely to be heterogeneous and considered to be fractal in its nature. One of the characteristics of fractal structure is the scale independence. An investigation of fractal properties on natural fractured rock is therefore needed for modelling larger fracture. We have investigated the possibilities of fractal upscaling method to produce a larger geothermal fracture model based on smaller fracture data. We generate Iterated Function System (IFS) fractal model using parameters e.g. scale factor, angle between branch, initial line direction, and branch thickness. All the model parameters are obtained from smaller fracture data. We generate higher iteration model to be compared with larger geothermal fracture. The similarity between the IFS fractal model and natural fracture is measured by 2D box counting fractal dimension (D). The fractal dimension of first to fourth generation fractal model is (1.86 ± 0.02). The fractal dimension of the reference geothermal site is (1.86 ± 0.04). Besides of D, we found significant similarity of fracture parameters there are intensity and density between fracture model and natural fracture. Based on these result, we conclude that fractal upscaling using IFS fractal model is potential to model larger scale of 2D fracture.},

Control over fiber diameter in electrospinning process was important since it will determine the performance of resulting nanofiber. Theoretically, fiber diameter was determined by surface tension, solution concentration, flow rate, and electric current. But experimentally it had been proven that significantly viscosity had an influence to fiber diameter. Jet radius equation in electrospinning process was divided into three areas: near the nozzle, far from the nozzle, and at jet terminal. There was no correlation between these equations. Superposition of exponential series model provides the equations combined into one, thus the entire of working parameters on electrospinning take a contribution to fiber diameter. This method yields the value of solution viscosity has a linear relation to jet radius. However, this method works only for low viscosity.},

One of the most common perovskite materials is lead based reagent. In this research, we have synthesized organolead halide with lead extracted from solder wire. In the preparation procedure, first PbCl2 and PbI2 are produced by reacting lead from the solder wire with NaCl and KI, which are used as the basic substance for the perovskite material. Then, in order to get perovskite solution, the powders are reacted with methylamine iodide (MAI) in dimethylformamide (DMF) using a solution based method. Further, the spin coating method is used to fabricate perovskite thin film. The XRD peak results agreed with JCPDS Powder Diffraction of PbCl 2 and PbI2. Based on FTIR, the transmittance spectra of the organolead mixed halide that was prepared using solder wire lead exhibited absorption peaks identical to organolead mixed halide using commercial lead. The UV-Vis absorbance spectra of the organolead mixed halide from solder wire lead also exhibited the same absorption ability as from commercial lead. Morever, EDS measurement showed that the element composition of the perovskite thin film using lead from solder wire identical to that from commercial lead. This indicates that solder wire lead is suitable enough for organolead halide material synthesis.},

Some possible system to detect earthquake is by creating a vibration sensor system using accelerometer. However, the output of the system is usually put in the form of acceleration data. Therefore, a calibrator system for accelerometer to sense the vibration is needed. In this study, a simple accelerometer calibrator has been developed using 12 V DC motor, optocoupler, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and AVR 328 microcontroller as controller system. The system uses the Pulse Wave Modulation (PWM) form microcontroller to control the motor rotational speed as response to vibration frequency. The frequency of vibration was read by optocoupler and then those data was used as feedback to the system. The results show that the systems could control the rotational speed and the vibration frequencies in accordance with the defined PWM.},

One of challenging problems is to implement this method for the case of light propagation in amplifying medium or structures, such as optical amplifier and lasers. The implementation is hindered by the fact that the dielectric constant becomes a complex number when optical gain parameter is involved in the calculation. In general, complex dielectric constant is related to complex susceptibility, in which the imaginary part is related to optical gain. Here, we then modify the formulation for updating electric field in the calculation algorithm. Using this approach, we then finally can calculate light amplification in laser active medium of Nd 3+ ion doped glass. The calculation result shows an agreement with the result from the calculation using differential equation for intensity. Although this method is more time consuming, the method seem promising for optical complex micro- and nano-structures, such quantum dot lasers, micro-ring lasers, etc.},

Vector finite element attempt to overcome those nonphysical solutions by using the edges of the element as vector basis.

The values of boundary conditions follow the potential values used in two electrodes brain ECVT, and for this reason the first boundary is set to 20 volt and 2.5 MHz signal and another boundary is set to ground. Poisson equation is implemented as the governing equation in the 2D brain geometry and finite element method is used to solve the equation.

	abstract = {A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based on methacrylic acid (MAA) monomer and theophylline template has been synthesized using a modified bulk polymerization method. Theophylline was employed as a template and it formed a complex with MAA through hydrogen bonding. Self-assembly of template-monomer was followed by cross-linking process using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) cross-linker. The polymerization process was initiated by thermal decomposition of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as the initiator at 60 o C after cooling treatment at -5 o C. After 7 hours, a rigid polymer was obtained and followed by grinding the polymer and removing the template. As a reference, a nonimprinted polymer (NIP) has also been synthesized using similar procedure by excluding the template. FTIR study was carried out to investigate the presence of theophylline in the as- prepared polymer, MIP, and NIP. The spectra indicated that theophylline was successfully incorporated in the as-prepared polymer. This result was also confirmed by EDS analysis showing that N atoms of the as-prepared polymer were derived from amino group of theophylline. Furthermore, the polymer particles of MIP were irregular in shape and size as shown by its SEM image. The capability of guest-rebinding of the MIP was analyzed through Batchwise guest-binding experiment. The results showed that for initial concentration of theophylline in methanol/chloroform (1/1, v/v) of 0.333 mM, the binding capacity of the MIP was 23.22 /mol/g. Compared to the MIP, the adsorption capacity of the NIP was only 3.73 /mol/g. This result shows that MIP has higher affinity than NIP.},

The project was done in the period of January to April 2015 when they was taking the Measurement and Data Processing Techniques, which is a compulsory course in the fourth semester of undergraduate program in Department of Physics at Institut Teknologi Bandung. With the help of a lecturer and a tutor as facilitators, they have followed this series of steps: 1. Start with a driving question, a problem to be solved, 2. Exploring the driving question by participating in authentic, situated inquiry, 3. Engaging collaborative activities with lecturer and tutor to find solutions to the driving question, 4. Scaffolding with learning technologies that help students participating in activities normally beyond their ability, and 5. Creating a set of tangible products that address the driving question. With this series of steps, the students have become easier to understand the lectures that have been given and the instrument has been realized to measure the temperature of water properly. When realizing the project under the PBL method, we learned other materials beside that have been taught in the course. Due to this project, we have had more skills like designing and soldering as well as problem-solving, teamwork, critical thinking, synthesis and analysis.},

Osteoporosis is a disease associated with bone mass decreases. Since montmorillonite has ability to exchange its cation (Ca+2), therefore, it plays an important role in preventing or/and cure human bone from osteoporosis. In order to understand how Ca-montmorillonite can do detoxification in the human body, we firstly investigated the mechanism of Pb adsorption on the surface of Ca-montmorillonite in an atomic level point of view. We found that the repulsive interactions between H of OH groups with Ca and Pb yielding the rotation of the H of OH groups of montmorillonite. A relatively small movement of Ca was observed when Pb is adsorbed and the band gap of Ca- montmorillonite becomes 1.87 eV narrow.},

	abstract = {Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is one of promising photovoltaic materials due to its simplicity in fabrication process and rich variety of possible sensitizer molecules. DSSC cell is commonly constructed of TiO 2 layer as photoelectrode, dye as photosensitizer, electrolyte as redox mediator, and platinum layer as counter electrode. TiO 2 layer is often constructed from different types of layers, such as blocking layer, transparent layer, microchannel or light scattering layer, which is made usually by successive layer-by-layer process. In this work, different TiO 2 layers with different thickness and heat treatment were prepared and then used to build a complete sandwich-type DSSC. The characterization results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is slightly reduced when using TiO 2 layer with multiple scattering layers. This reduction is caused by an increase in the resistance from charge transport and charge transfer inside the mesoporous TiO 2 layer, as revealed from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement results. Additional heat treatment introduced at the final step in the TiO 2 layer preparation process, however, slightly improve the cell performance. Although this heat treatment does not produce significant change in porosity or pore size distribution of the TiO 2 layer, it might be able to improve the contact between the TiO 2 nanoparticles. The best PCE achieved in this work is about 5.3\%, which was observed in the cell using TiO 2 layer with one scattering layer and additional heat treatment.},

The hydrocarbon spills are generally recognized as Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (LNAPL) if the plume of leakage is distributed in the capillary fringe above the water table and as Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPL) if it is below the water table. GPR antennas of 200 MHz and 400 MHz were deployed to obtain clear radargrams until 4 m deep. In general, the interpreted radargram sections indicate the presence of surface concrete layer, the compacted silty soill followed by sand layer and the original clayey soil as well as the water table. The presence of hydrocarbon plumes are identified as shadow zones (radar velocity and intensity contrasts) in the radargram that blur the layering pattern with different intensity of reflected signal. Based on our results, the characteristic of the shadow zones in the radargram is controlled by several factors: types of hydrocarbon (fresh or bio-degraded), water moisture in the soil, and clay content which contribute variation in electrical conductivity and dielectric constants of the soil.},

The resistivity method concerns with resistivity (ohm.m) of rocks which indicates the electrical properties in terms of ability to resist the flow of electrical current. The presence of manganese in rocks generally lowers the resistivity. The Induced Polarization (IP) method deals with chargeability (in msec) which indicates the strength of polarization effects experienced by ions in the vicinity of metallic grains in rock. The presence of manganese in rocks increases the chargeability of the rock when measured using IP method. The low resistivity zones ({\textless} 5 ohm.m) are situated in the western part, central part, and eastern part of the investigated area. These zones may strongly correlate to the presence of manganese ore. However, these low resistivity zones may have been influenced by the presence of clay or weathered soil. In this case, the high chargeability zones will help in confirming the prospective zones caused by manganese ore. The thicknesses of the manganese ore layer vary from about 5 to 20 m based on the cross-sections. Based on the results, we estimated the geometry of the associated manganese prospective zones for resistivity (10 msec).},

The granular materials are 4 mm diameter marbles, which are put in a flat drum with 16 cm diameter and 5 mm thickness. Rotation axis of the drum is always perpendicular to the direction of gravity. Granular materials in a vertical rotating drum usually have six modes of motion i.e. slipping, slumping, rolling, cascading, cataracting, and centrifuging. Those modes depend on number of granular particles, rotation speed, and types of materials of granular particles. Characterization of modes of motion in this work has been conducted by varying number of particles, rotation speed, and types of materials. Rotation speed is varied from 15 rpm to 125 rpm, while number of granular material is varied from 50 to 600. Each steel and plastic granular materials has five modes of motion with centrifuging mode is absence in observation of steel materials and slipping mode is absence in observation of plastic materials, both for the same parameter ranges used in the experiments. Parameters room of number of particles against rotation speed for both types of materials are presented.},

Yeast was used in the anolyte, to transfer electrons to the anode in the presence of methylene blue as mediator whereas K 3 Fe(CN) 6 was used as an electron acceptor for the reduction reaction in the catholyte. Power production with biofuel cell was coupled with a desalination process. The maximum current density produced by the cell was 88 mA.m -2 . In those conditions, it was found that concentration of salt was removed 64\% from initial 0.6 M after 1-month operation. This result proves that yeast fuel cells can be used to remove salt through electrically driven membrane processes and demonstrated that could be applied for energy production and desalination. Further developments are in progress to improve power output to make yeast fuel cells applicable for water treatment.},

Furthermore, it can form biofilm that resists drug effective therapy. The formation of the colony is affected by the interaction between cells and with its growth media. The cell budding pattern holds an important role in colony expansion. To study this colony growth, the molecular dynamic method was chosen to simulate the interaction between budding yeast cells. Every cell was modelled by circular granular cells, which can grow and produce buds. Cohesion force, contact force, and Stokes force govern this model to mimic the interaction between cells and with the growth substrate. Characterization was determined by the maximum ( L max ) and minimum ( L min ) distances between two cells within the colony and whether two lines that connect the two cells in the maximum and minimum distances intersect each other. Therefore, it can be recognized the colony shape in circular, oval, and irregular shapes. Simulation resulted that colony formation are mostly in oval shape with little branch. It also shows that greater cohesion strength obtains more compact colony formation.},

Hypocenters of microseismic events is represented movements of reinjection fluids that means it could be space where fractured zone is formed. We use Single Event Determination (SED) method to relocate the hypocenters of microseismic event during the period of January - June 2014. About 179 events of micro earthquake were recorded on that period, these micro earthquake have magnitudes in range of 0.4 to 2.1 SR. Some of them are related to reinjection fluid from injection well INJ21. The hypocenters which is related to injection fluid from INJ21 shows that fractured zones exist on there. These fractured zones is located in geothermal reservoirs based on the geological setting. Fractured zones caused by high pressure of reinjection fluid where it happens in geothermal reservoirs containing high temperature, when reinjection water contacted with high temperature reservoir, it will be a new fractured zones because of high intensity of micro earthquake events.},

The flat coil element being developed is an inductive proximity sensor for detection mass of soil movement. The simple method of flat coil manufactures and low cost, is an attraction that is still inspired to develop flat coil sensors. Meanwhile, although it has a drawback in terms of their size, the coil sensor is still required in many fields due to their sensitivity and robustness. The simple method of coil manufacture and the materials are commonly available and low cost, is an attraction that is still inspired to develop induction coil sensors. A comparative study of alternative configuration of sensor based on flat coil elements and a coil in application to landslide detection has been discussed in this paper.

The lagrangians for the gravitational field in TG and for the Yang-Mills field in standard gauge theory differ due to different indices that stick on the components of the corresponding fields: two external indices for tetrad field and internal and external indices for the Yang-Mills field. Different types of indices lead to different possible contractions and thus lead to different expression of the lagrangian for the Yang Mills field and for the tetrad field. As TG is a gauge theory it is then natural to quantize gravity in TG by applying the same procedure of quantization as in the standard gauge theory. Here we will discuss on the possibility to quantize gravity, canonically and functionally, under the framework of TG theory.},

Furthermore, the effect of physical parameters to the quality of radiographic images and the comparison of image quality resulted from simulation in the GPU and CPU are evaluated in this paper. The simulations were run in CPU which was simulated in serial condition, and in two GPU with 384 cores and 2304 cores. In simulation using GPU, each cores calculates one photon, so, a large number of photon were calculated simultaneously. Results show that the time simulations on GPU were significantly accelerated compared to CPU. The simulations on the 2304 core of GPU were performed about 64 -114 times faster than on CPU, while the simulation on the 384 core of GPU were performed about 20 – 31 times faster than in a single core of CPU. Another result shows that optimum quality of images from the simulation was gained at the history start from 108 and the energy from 60 Kev to 90 Kev.

This reactor can be operated without enrichment and reprocessing forever, once it starts. To obtain the capability of consuming natural uranium as fuel cycle input modified CANDLE burn-up scheme was adopted in this system with different core design. This study has compared the core with three designs of core reactors with the same thermal power 600 MWth. The fuel composition each design was arranged by divided core into several parts of equal volume axially i.e. 6, 8 and 10 parts related to material burn-up history. The fresh natural uranium is initially put in region 1, after one cycle of 10 years of burn-up it is shifted to region 2 and the region 1 is filled by fresh natural uranium fuel. This concept is basically applied to all regions, i.e. shifted the core of the region (i) into region (i+1) region after the end of 10 years burn-up cycle. The calculation results shows that for the burn-up strategy on “Region-8” and “Region-10” core designs, after the reactors start-up the operation furthermore they only needs natural uranium supply to the next life operation until one period of refueling (10 years).},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the pipeline leak is a serious problem for water distributions in big cities and the government that needs action and a great solution. Several techniques have been developed to improve the accuracy, the limitation of losses, and decrease environmental damage. However, these methods need highly costs and complexity equipment. This paper presents a simple method to determine leak location with the gradient intersection method calculations. A simple water distribution system have been built on PVC pipeline along 4m, diameter 15mm and 12 pressure sensors which placed into the pipeline. Each sensor measured the pressure for each point and send the data to microcontroller. The artificial hole was made between the sixth and seventh of sensor. With three holes, the system calculated and analyzed the leak location with error 3.67\%.},

The Morgenstern-Price method was used to estimate the potential sliding zone and volume of landslide material. The center of mass approach used a simple Coulomb friction model to determine the run-out distance. Results of the slope stability analysis showed that the soil unit weight can influence the depth of sliding zone, and the volume of unstable material. The slope model of silty sand and gravel would have the largest volume of unstable mass. From the Coulomb friction analysis, this slope model has higher run-out distance and velocity than other slope models. Thus, the run-out distance will be influenced by soil type and the dimension of unstable soil mass.},

	abstract = {Permeability plays an important role to determine the characteristics of how fluids flow through a porous medium which can be estimated using various methods. Darcy's law and the Kozeny-Carman equation are two of the most utilized methods in estimating permeability. In Darcy's law, permeability can be calculated by applying a pressure gradient between opposing sides of inlet-outlet of a certain direction. The permeability then depends on the fluid viscosity and the flowrate. The Kozeny-Carman equation is an empirical equation which depends on several parameters such as shape factor of the pore, tortuosity, specific surface area, and porosity to determine the permeability. For both methods, digital image obtained by means of Micro CT-Scan is used. In this research, the permeability estimation using the Darcy's law was conducted by simulating fluid flow through the digital image using Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). As for the Kozeny-Carman equation, digital image analysis was used to obtain the required parameters. Two Kozeny-Carman equations were used to calculate the permeability of the samples. The first equation (KC1) depends on pore shape factor, porosity, tortuosity, and specific surface area while the second equation (KC2) only depends on pore radius, porosity, and tortuosity. We investigate the methods by first testing on three simple pipe models which vary in the radii. By using the result from Darcy's law as a reference, we compare the results from the Kozeny-Carman equations. From the calculation, KC2 yield smaller difference to the reference. The three methods were then applied to the Fontainebleau sandstone to verify the previous result.},

	abstract = {The non-discharges geothermal wells have been a main problem in geothermal development stages and well discharge stimulation is required to initiate a flow. Air compress stimulation is one of the methods to trigger a fluid flow from the geothermal reservoir. The result of this process can be predicted by using by the Af / Ac method, but sometimes this method shows uncertainty result in several geothermal wells and also this prediction method does not take into account the flowing time of geothermal fluid to discharge after opening the well head. This paper presents a simulation of non-discharges well under air compress stimulation to predict well behavior and time process required. The component of this model consists of geothermal well data during heating-up process such as pressure, temperature and mass flow in the water column and main feed zone level. The one-dimensional transient numerical model is run based on the Single Fluid Volume Element (SFVE) method. According to the simulation result, the geothermal well behavior prediction after air compress stimulation will be valid under two specific circumstances, such as single phase fluid density between 1 - 28 kg/m 3 and above 28.5 kg/m 3 . The first condition shows that successful well discharge and the last condition represent failed well discharge after air compress stimulation (only for two wells data). The comparison of pf values between simulation and field observation shows the different result according to the success discharge well. Time required for flow to occur as observed in well head by using the SFVE method is different with the actual field condition. This model needs to improve by updating more geothermal well data and modified fluid phase condition inside the wellbore.},

	abstract = {Earth attenuates high frequencies from seismic wavelet. Low frequency seismics cannot be obtained by low quality geophone. The low frequencies (0-10 Hz) that are not present in seismic data are important to obtain a good result in acoustic impedance (AI) inversion. AI is important to determine reservoir quality by converting AI to reservoir properties like porosity, permeability and water saturation. The low frequencies can be supplied from impedance log (AI logs), velocity analysis, and from the combination of both data. In this study, we propose that the low frequencies could be obtained from the envelope seismic attribute. This new proposed method is essentially a modified BLIMP (Band Limited Impedance) inversion method, in which the AI logs for BLIMP substituted with the envelope attribute. In low frequency domain (0-10 Hz), the envelope attribute produces high amplitude. This low frequency from the envelope attribute is utilized to replace low frequency from AI logs in BLIMP. Linear trend in this method is acquired from the AI logs. In this study, the method is applied on synthetic seismograms created from impedance log from well ‘X’. The mean squared error from the modified BLIMP inversion is 2-4\% for each trace (variation in error is caused by different normalization constant), lower than the conventional BLIMP inversion which produces error of 8\%. The new method is also applied on Marmousi2 dataset and show promising result. The modified BLIMP inversion result from Marmousi2 by using one log AI is better than the one produced from the conventional method.},

This study concerns the simulation of neutron contamination emitted from Varian Clinac iX 10 MV using Monte Carlo code system. As neutron production process is very complex, Monte Carlo simulation with MCNPX code system was carried out to study this contamination. The design of this medical accelerator was modelled based on the actual materials and geometry. The maximum energy of photons and neutron in the scoring plane was 10.5 and 2.239 MeV, respectively. The number and energy of the particles produced depend on the depth and distance from beam axis.

The multiple scan output dose profile (MSDP) in the axial mode was calculated using convolution between SSDP and delta function, whereas for the helical mode MSDP was calculated using convolution between SSDP and the rectangular function. MSDPs were calculated for a number of scans (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25). The multiple scan average dose (MSAD) for differing numbers of scans was compared to the value of CT dose index (CTDI). Finally, the edge values of MSDP for every scan number were compared to the corresponding MSAD values. MSDPs were successfully generated by using convolution between a SSDP and the appropriate function. We found that CTDI only accurately estimates MSAD when the number of scans was more than 10.

Bone's image segmentation is a way to get bone dimensions, which is needed in order to make prosthesis that is used to treat broken or cracked bones. Segmentation methods chosen in this study are fast marching and geodesic active contours. This study uses ITK (Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit) software. The success of the segmentation was then determined by calculating its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Based on the results, the Active Contours method has slightly higher accuracy and sensitivity values than the fast marching method. As for the value of specificity, fast marching has produced three image results that have higher specificity values compared to those of geodesic active contour's. The result also indicates that both methods have succeeded in performing bone's image segmentation. Overall, geodesic active contours method is quite better than fast marching in segmenting bone images.},

These three methods require one important parameter, i.e the threshold. The threshold interval was obtained from the histogram of the original image. The software used to segment the image here was InsightToolkit-4.7.0 (ITK). This research used 5 lung images to be analyzed. Then, the results were compared using the performance evaluation parameter determined by using MATLAB. The segmentation method is said to have a good quality if it has the smallest MSE value and the highest PSNR. The results show that four sample images match the criteria of connected threshold, while one sample refers to the threshold level set segmentation. Therefore, it can be concluded that connected threshold method is better than the other two methods for these cases.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the composition of urinary stones is an essential part to determine suitable treatments for patients. The aim of this research is to characterize the urinary stones by using dual energy micro CT SkyScan 11173. This technique combines high-energy and low- energy scanning during a single acquisition. Six human urinary stones were scanned in vitro using 80 kV and 120 kV micro CT SkyScan 1173. Projected images were produced by micro CT SkyScan 1173 and then reconstructed using NRecon (in-house software from SkyScan) to obtain a complete 3D image. The urinary stone images were analysed using CT analyser to obtain information of internal structure and Hounsfield Unit (HU) values to determine the information regarding the composition of the urinary stones, respectively. HU values obtained from some regions of interest in the same slice are compared to a reference HU. The analysis shows information of the composition of the six scanned stones obtained. The six stones consist of stone number 1 (calcium+cystine), number 2 (calcium+struvite), number 3 (calcium+cystine+struvite), number 4 (calcium), number 5 (calcium+cystine+struvite), and number 6 (calcium+uric acid). This shows that dual energy micro CT SkyScan 1173 was able to characterize the composition of the urinary stone.},

	abstract = {This research aims to study brain's electrical signals recorded using EEG as a basis for the diagnosis of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The subjects consisted of patients with AD, and normal subjects are used as the control. Brain signals are recorded for 3 minutes in a relaxed condition and with eyes closed. The data is processed using power spectral analysis, brain mapping and chaos test to observe the level of complexity of EEG's data. The results show a shift in the power spectral in the low frequency band (delta and theta) in AD patients. The increase of delta and theta occurs in lobus frontal area and lobus parietal respectively. However, there is a decrease of alpha activity in AD patients where in the case of normal subjects with relaxed condition, brain alpha wave dominates the posterior area. This is confirmed by the results of brain mapping. While the results of chaos analysis show that the average value of MMLE is lower in AD patients than in normal subjects. The level of chaos associated with neural complexity in AD patients with lower neural complexity is due to neuronal damage caused by the beta amyloid plaques and tau protein in neurons.},

The first electrode was defined as a Dirichlet boundary condition with 20 V in potential and another electrode was defined as a Dirichlet boundary condition with 0 V in potential. Simulated Hodgkin-Huxley -based action potentials were applied as electrical activity of the brain and sequentially were put on 3 different cross-sectional positions. As the governing equation, the Poisson equation was implemented in the geometry. Poisson equation was solved by finite element method. The simulation showed that the simulated capacitance values were affected by action potentials and cross-sectional action potential positions.},

We propose a new model of DNA-protein interactions to depict the dynamics of specific DNA-protein interactions. Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) are, among the other intermolecular interactions in DNA, the most distinctive in term of specificity of molecular bonds. As H-bonds account for specificity, we only consider the dynamics affected by H-bonds between DNA base pairs and H-bonds connecting protein side chains and DNA. The H-bonds are modelled by Morse potentials and coupling terms in the Hamiltonian of coupled oscillators resembling a coupling between planar DNA chain and a protein molecule. In this paper we give a perturbative approach as an attempt for a soliton solution. The solution is in the form of nonlinear travelling wave having the amplitudes satisfying coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations and is interpreted as the mediator for nonlocal transmittance of biological information in DNA.},

Compartment model consist two icosphere with different size, with cell diameter for 0.8 μm and nucleus diameter varies for about 0.4, 0.5, and 6 μm, respectively. Another parameter was their width and a model of receptor on the surface of the nucleus. During investigation, an amount of receptor was 120, 150, and 180 grid element. The model was collected and separated. The diffusion process flew from cell to the nucleus and returned to the cell with 2000 molecules on surface. MCell successfully simulated compartment model for a cell and the nucleus. Diffusion process depended on the diameter of the nucleus. The greater the nucleus, more effective the speed of diffusion process would be because the concentration inside the cell was increase and concentration in the nucleus was decrease.},

Furthermore, it can form biofilm that resists drug effective therapy. The formation of the colony is affected by the interaction between cells and with its growth media. The cell budding pattern holds an important role in colony expansion. To study this colony growth, the molecular dynamic method was chosen to simulate the interaction between budding yeast cells. Every cell was modelled by circular granular cells, which can grow and produce buds. Cohesion force, contact force, and Stokes force govern this model to mimic the interaction between cells and with the growth substrate. Characterization was determined by the maximum ( L max ) and minimum ( L min ) distances between two cells within the colony and whether two lines that connect the two cells in the maximum and minimum distances intersect each other. Therefore, it can be recognized the colony shape in circular, oval, and irregular shapes. Simulation resulted that colony formation are mostly in oval shape with little branch. It also shows that greater cohesion strength obtains more compact colony formation.},

To address this issue, in the moment of the total solar eclipse of 9 March 2016 passing most regions in Indonesia, we undertook microgravity measurements using two precise gravimeters. The measurements were made at two locations: (1) Poso (central Sulawesi), a location close to the centre passage of the total eclipse and (2) Lembang (West Java), the site of Bosscha Observatory, where the partial solar eclipse occurred. The two sites are selected to measure the possible different influence of the eclipse on aligning the three objects. The measurements were recorded three days before and one day after the eclipse at various intervals from 30 seconds to a short time at 5 seconds. The finer recording was performed several hours before and after the total eclipse. This measurement allowed detailed analysis, not only in time but also in frequency range. A detailed analysis is presented in this paper. We consider all possible geophysical as well as atmospheric effects. The residual data show that the shielding effect, usually thought as responsible factor on anomalous gravity, is not significant.},

Time-resolved imaging of the Sun has been conducted before, after, and during totality of eclipse while optical spectroscopic observation has been carried out only at the totality. The imaging observation in white light was done to take high resolution images of solar corona. The images were taken with a DSLR camera that is attached to a refractor telescope (d=66 mm, f/5.9). Despite cloudy weather during the eclipse moments, we managed to obtain the images with lower signal-to-noise ratio, including identifiable diamond ring, prominence and coronal structure. The images were processed using standard reduction procedure to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to enhance the corona. Then, the coronal structure is determined and compared with ultraviolet data from SOHO to analyze the correlation between visual and ultraviolet corona. The spectroscopic observation was conducted using a slit-less spectrograph and a DSLR camera to obtain solar flash spectra. The flash spectra taken during the eclipse show emissions of H 4861 Å, He I 5876 Å, and H 6563 Å. The Fe XIV 5303 Å and Fe X 6374 Å lines are hardly detected due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Spectral reduction and analysis are conducted to derive the emission lines intensity relative to continuum intensity.

Next, we calculated the length of prominence from TSE images, and found that the real minimum length of prominence in red is 1.05 times longer than green and blue ones. And, the real maximum length of prominence is 1.08 times longer than blue and 1.04 times longer than green. The intensity of red is brighter 1.37 times to green and 1.23 times to blue.

Image processing of coronal images was done using RegiStax and PhotoScape freewares. To study solar corona, images from Virtual Moon Atlas, Hinode XRT, and SOHO-LASCO were compared with the result of oriented coronal image. Wider and many more moon craters were found having positive correlation with the brighter effect on solar corona as shown at westward coronal streamer. Those craters are represented by Bel'kovich crater, the biggest one.

Furthermore we add two “wrong” choices in the last questions to identify less serious respondents. We analyze 60 respondents of Palembang who visited Ampera bridge area. Our result shows no correlation between the number of information access and the level of understanding about TSE. We also found that local media did not provide the scientific content of TSE as well as the national media.},

	abstract = {The aim of this research is to detect misconceptions in the concept of physics at high school level by using astronomy questions as a testing instrument. Misconception is defined as a thought or an idea that is different from what has been agreed by experts who are reliable in the field, and it is believed to interfere with the acquisition of new understanding and integration of new knowledge or skills. While lack of concept or knowledge can be corrected with the next instruction and learning, students who have misconceptions have to “unlearn” their misconception before learning a correct one. Therefore, the ability to differentiate between these two things becomes crucial. CRI is one of the methods that can identify efficiently, between misconceptions and lack of knowledge that occur in the students. This research used quantitative- descriptive method with ex-post-facto research approach. An instrument used for the test is astronomy questions that require an understanding of physics concepts to solve the problem. By using astronomy questions, it is expected to raise a better understanding such that a concept can be viewed from various fields of science. Based on test results, misconceptions are found on several topics of physics. This test also revealed that student's ability to analyse a problem is still quite low.},

We derived physical parameters of NGC 6543 and NGC 7662 from the analyses of observed emission lines, i.e. electron temperature, density, and elemental abundances. To obtain more reliable physical quantities of NGC 6543 and NGC 7662, the use of photoionization model is needed. We use the computer code, CLOUDY C13.3 to build detailed photoionization models of NGC 6543 and NGC 7662. Model of NGC 6543 and 7662 can be constructed by providing sufficient information on physical parameters of the central stars and the nebula. In this work, input parameters to construct the photoionization model of NGC 6543 and NGC 7662 are distance, temperature and luminosity of central star and nebula parameters. The model results were compared with observational result taken in 2014. Observed and modeled temperatures were deduced from [O III] λλ(4959 + 5007) Å /λ4636 Å and the electron density from [S II] λλ 6716/6731 Å. There are some discrepancies between observed and modeled due to limitations inherent with the resolution and quality of spectroscopic data. Further spectroscopic observations with higher resolution of NGC 6543 and NGC 7662 is recommended.},

Parametric method with a double elliptic bivariate gaussian function which contains 11 parameters is used as a model of the proper motion distribution. The value of these parameters are determined numerically by cross entropy method. This method is a method of data fitting using the likelihood function whose value is maximized to get the proper parameters. This method solves the problem of determining the initial value that is often difficult to determine in other numerical methods. There are four open clusters which we have analysed: NGC 2244, ASCC 100, NGC 5168, and NGC 2169. The resulting of proper motion parameters of this method matches the parameters in the literature.},

The darkest night could reach 22.61 mpass only in several seconds, with mean value 18.8±0.7 mpass and temperature variation 23.1±1.2 C. The difference of mean sky brightness between before and after midnight was about -0.76 mpass or 2.0 times brighter. Moreover, the sky brightness and temperature fluctuations were more stable in after midnight than in before midnight. It is suggested that city light pollution affects those variations, and subsequently duration of twilight.

Two boundary conditions are required by this model, where the first is cloud thickness potential H 0 and the second is aerosol concentration N 0 . The initial conditions are simply H (0) = 0 and N (0) = 0. Several pairs of (H 0 , N 0 ) values are chosen in calculating the precipitation. Three categories of rainfall are used in this work, which are no drizzle D0, light drizzle D1, and drizzle D2. As H evolves in time t , it produces maximum cloud thickness H max and saturation cloud thickness H sat , as also N does N max and N sat . Two kinds of cloud thickness difference, Δ H 1 = H 0 - H ma x and Δ H 2 = H 0 - H sat are proposed and also for cloud concentration difference Δ N 1 and Δ N 2 with similar definitions. Pairs of (Δ H 1 , Δ N 1 ) and (Δ H 2 , Δ N 2 ) are used in analyzing simulation results. The first pair can be used as prediction of rainfall occurrence, while the second pair is more for confirmation and understanding the relation between cloud thickness and cloud concentration in producing rainfall. It is observed that H {\textless} H 0 and N {\textless} N 0 are always fulfilled. Rainfall in category D2 will have significant differences in H and N , while in category D0 will not. Typical differences for H are about 80\% and 30-50\% for both cases. Deeper discussion about (Δ H 1 , Δ N 1 ) and (Δ H 2 , Δ N 2 ) is presented in this work.},

Using the MCS data and radiative transfer model coupled with an automated inversion routine, we can investigate the chemical composition of the high altitude clouds. We will present the first results on the properties of the clouds. CO 2 ice is the best candidate to be the main component of some high altitude clouds due to the most similar spectral variation compared to water ice or dust, in agreement with previous studies. Using cloud composition of contaminated CO 2 ice (dust core surrounded by CO 2 ice) might improve the fitting result, but further study is needed.},

In planar case it possesses five equilibrium points consisting of three collinear (L 1 , L 2 , and L 3 ) and two triangular (L 4 and L 5 ). To mimic a better astrophysical R3BP, such as motion of a satellite in star-planet system, the classical problem can be generalized by considering the effects of radiation pressure and oblate spheroid shape on the primaries. We study analytically the locations and the stability of L 4 and L 5 equilibrium points in the frame of ER3BP with incorporating the effects of radiation for bigger primary and oblateness for smaller primary. Our study suggests that the oblateness factor (A 2 ) and the radiation factor (q 1 ) shift the positions of L 4 and L 5 points compared with the classical ones. We also find that there is a stability limit for motion of the third body around these points.},

	abstract = {A type I supemovae (SN Ia) is an exploding white dwarf, whose mass exceeds Chandrasekar limit (1.44 solar mass). If a white dwarf is in a binary system, it may accrete matter from the companion, resulting in an excess mass that cannot be balanced by the pressure of degenerated electrons in the core. SNe Ia are highly luminous objects, that they are visible from very high distances. After some corrections (stretch (s), colour (c), K-corrections, etc.), the variations in the light curves of SNe Ia can be suppressed to be no more than 10\%. Their high luminosity and almost uniform intrinsic brightness at the peak light, i.e. M B ∼ -19, make SNe Ia ideal standard candle. Because of their visibility from large distances, SNe Ia can be employed as a cosmological measuring tool. It was analysis of SNe Ia data that indicated for the first time, that the universe is not only expanding, but also accelerating. This work analyzed a compilation of SNe Ia data to determine several cosmological parameters (H 0 , Ω m , Ω a , and w ). It can be concluded from the analysis, that our universe is a flat, dark energy dominated universe, and that the cosmological constant A is a suitable candidate for dark energy.},

ULXs are often explained using two different scenarios, (1) ULXs as intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with sub-Eddington accretion and (2) ULXs as stellar mass black hole with super-Eddington accretion. There are two methods that commonly used to study the characteristics of ULXs. One method is to study the X-ray spectra of ULXs, to determine the characteristics of their accretion flows from fitting their spectra using available spectral models. The other method is to investigate how population of ULXs correlate with their environment, in this case their host galaxies. Our goal is to find correlation between ULXs and the properties of its host galaxies, for example with Star Formation Rate (SFR), mass and morphology. From this study we found a positive correlation between ULXs number and SFR. From X-ray luminosity function, we found upper limit of black holes mass that power ULXs is about 100 M ⊙ .},

The study of the properties of a Halin graph has received much attention. For instances, it has been shown that every Halin graph is 3-connected and Hamiltonian. A Halin graph has also treewidth at most three, so that many graph optimization problems that are NP-complete for arbitrary planar graphs may be solved in linear time on Halin graphs using dynamic programming. In this paper, we characterize all Halin graphs with 3,4,5,6, and 7 inner faces and give their locating-chromatic number.

	abstract = {When a uniform stream on an open channel is disturbed by existing of a bump at the bottom of the channel, the surface boundary forms waves growing splitting and propagating. The model of the wave generation can be a forced Korteweg de Vries (fKdV) equation or Boussinesq-type equations. In case the governing equations are approximated from steady problem, the fKdV equation is obtained. The model gives two solutions representing solitary-like wave, with different amplitude. However, phyically there is only one profile generated from that process. Which solution is occured, we confirm from unsteady model. The Boussinesq equations are proposed to determine the stabil solution of the fKdV equation. From the linear and steady model, its solution is developed to determine the analytical solution of the unsteady equations, so that it can explain the physical phenomena, i.e. the process of the wave generation, wave splitting and wave propagation. The solution can also determine the amplitude and wave speed of the waves.},

This scheme is of course also applicable to solve the shallow water equations. However this scheme is not robust to deal with dry bed, that is, spurious oscillations appear around wet-dry areas. In this paper we propose a modified two-four finite difference scheme to solve the shallow water equations involving (almost) dry bed. The modified scheme has fewer number of divisions by zero or almost zero, and at the same time, only conserved quantities (mass and momentum) are used in the evolution of the new scheme. The modification lies on the discretisation of the momentum equation. We discretise the momentum equation using the momentum variable itself rather than using the velocity variable as done by Mohapatra and Chaudhry. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is more robust for wetting and drying processes of the shallow water equations.},

Data was collected using multiple-choice test consisting of eight questions. The participants were required to give answers along with their reasoning. The test was developed based on the indicators of concept comprehension. The study was conducted to 161 college students enrolled in stereochemistry topic in the odd semester (2014/2015) from two LPTK (teacher training institutes) in Bandar Lampung and Gorontalo, and one public university in Bandung. The result indicates that college students’ level of comprehension towards 3D molecule representations and its inter-conversion was 5\% on high level, 22 \% on the moderate level, and 73 \% on the low level. The dominant factors identified as the cause of difficulties to comprehend 3D molecule representation and its interconversion were (i) the lack of spatial awareness, (ii) violation of absolute configuration determination rules, (iii) imprecise placement of observers, (iv) the lack of rotation operation, and (v) the lack of understanding of correlation between the representations. This study recommends that learning show more rigorous spatial awareness training tasks accompanied using dynamic visualization media of molecules associated. Also students learned using static molecular models can help them overcome their difficulties encountered.},

The Raman and FT-IR studies showed that curcumin preferrably interacted with T20 and altered PVP chain packing, as supported by XRD and physical stability data. The hydroxyl stretching band in PVP shifted to a lower wavenumber with higher intenstity in the presence of curcumin and PVP, indicating that hydrogen bond formation is more intense in a curcumin or curcumin–T20 containing fiber. The thermal pattern of the fiber did not indicate phase separation. The conversion of curcumin into an amorphous state was confirmed by XRD analysis.

Plots of diffusion coefficients versus inverse viscosity deviate from expected linearity, especially for ILs with different kind of anions, suggesting that anions of the ILs contribute to the values of diffusion coefficients. ED for both complexes in ILs are found slightly larger compared to the activation energies of viscous flow (Eη) for the corresponding IL, indicating that the viscosity is not the only factor determining the diffusion of the complexes.

PEG-1000 was used as a solvent, and as a size reducing and functionalizing agent. The advantages of the present method are that it is simple and relatively fast, and it only needs a small amount of reagents. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). From the XRD data, the average crystallite size, t, of the Gd2O3@PEG nanoparticles was calculated to be about 5.4, 3.8, and 3.1nm at decomposition temperatures of 260°C, 280°C and 300°C respectively. The SEM images revealed that the synthesized nanoparticles had a homogenous spherical shape while the coated nanoparticle diameters were about 178nm at 260°C. Synthesis at higher temperatures tended to cause agglomeration. FTIR analysis showed that the oxidation of PEG is linked to the Gd2O3 surface. Magnetization was investigated using a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). The magnetization vs. magnetic field (M–H) curve, measured at 300K, showed that the Gd2O3@PEG nanoparticles exhibit characteristic paramagnetic behavior. We confirmed that the dispersibility and functionalization behavior of the PEG was successfully transferred to the Gd2O3 nanoparticles.},

This research aims to determine the most stable structures of sulfonated nata de coco polymer membrane, the energy and hydrogen bonds, in order to understand the characteristics, local hydration, and proton transfer on the membrane on the ab initio electronic structure calculation. The minimum energy structure for its monomer (two, three, four and five) are calculated by B3LYP/6-311G (d) method. The calculations show that there is no significant energy change on the structure interaction of two, three, four and five monomer of sulfonated nata de coco with one water molecule, which is about -18.82 kcal/mole. Those calculations that two monomers form of sulfonated nata de coco might be used to further calculation and research, because it can be considered as the representative for their polymer. The optimization and B3LYP/6-311G (d) calculation shows the amount of water molecule used for proton transfer is closely related to the formation of hydrogen bonding with sulfonic group. By the addition of one or two water molecule, the dissociated proton is stabilized by formation of hydronium ion. For further addition of water molecule (three to ten water molecules), the proton dissociation is also stabilized by the formation of Zundel ion and Eigen ion. The calculation of interaction energy with n water molecule (n = 1-10) shows that both energy change (∆E), and enthalpy change (∆H) are more negative. This implies that the interaction with water molecule is stronger. The bonding energy is about 14.0-16.5 kcal/mole per water molecule. On the addition of four and eight water molecules, proton dissociation forms two Zundel ion and two Eigen ions and causes lower bonding energy about 2 kcal/mole. Those optimization and energy calculations conclude that the formation of hydrogen bonding among water molecule and sulfonic group affects proton transfer on sulfonated nata de coco membrane.},

	abstract = {High-surface-area macroporous WO3 particles with deposited Pt (Pt/WO3) were successfully synthesized for the first time, using flame-assisted spray pyrolysis. Nanoparticle aggregates-like structures (nanoaggregates) were formed, although a salt precursor was used for the synthesis. The macroporous structure was tailored by changing the mass ratio of the polystyrene template to ammonium tungstate pentahydrate. The cavities between the nanoaggregates formed mesopores, which increased the surface area. The presence of meso- and macro-pores in the synthesized Pt/WO3 particles improved their photocatalytic activities in visible-light-induced photodegradation of rhodamine B. The combination of a high surface area and the presence of an in situ-deposited Pt cocatalyst gave a high photodecomposition rate, approximately 9.6 times higher than that achieved with dense WO3 particles. This research provides a promising strategy for synthesizing submicron particles with high surface areas at a high production rate, and is suitable for industrial applications. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 62: 3864–3873, 2016},

The concentrations used in this paper were 0\% (pure ZnO), 2\%, and 8\% of Cu. The results show that the excitons are strongly observed in the ZnO film on quartz (ZOQ). However, they are significantly suppressed in the ZnO film on Pt (ZOP). These imply that the interactions of the valence itinerant electrons in Pt with ZnO film are responsible for the electronic blocking of electron (e)-hole (h) pairs or excitons. Furthermore, as a function of Cu doping, the screening effects on excitonic states and the new localized interband transition were observed for the ZOP and ZOQ systems. Our results confirm the different origins of the reduction of excitonic effects and the importance of the dielectric environments to strongly modify excitons and optical conductivity in a wide band-gap semiconductor.},

	abstract = {The rapidly growing demand for petroleum resources has become a crucial
global problem. Therefore, a more realistic solution is required for oil
production. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) has become an essential technique to
extract original oil content and maintain oil fields. During this process,
certain viscous polymers are commonly used as mobility control agents. In this
work, we introduce a new class of polymer to address the limitations of
commercial EOR polymers. We successfully extracted kappa-type carrageenan from Eucheuma
cottonii seaweed using demineralized water and ethanol precipitation. The
amount of yield, intrinsic viscosity, and viscosity-average molecular mass of
the extracted carrageenan were 18.64\%, 12.77 dLg-1, and 4.716×105
gmol-1, respectively. Characterizations were done by dynamic
viscosity and rheological measurement, along with a thermal degradation test.
The measurements indicated that kappa-carrageenan
is an attractive green substitute for polyacrylamide, as it showed relatively
high resistance to temperature, shear rate, and salinity compared to
polyacrylamide-based commercial EOR polymers. However, a higher concentration
of carrageenan is still needed to reach the same viscosity as the commercial
polymers.},

In this research, we carefully examine the morphology of KCC-1 to define more appropriate nomenclature. We also propose a formation mechanism of KCC-1 based on our experimental evidence. Herein, the KCC-1 morphology was interpreted mainly on the basis of compiling all observation and information taken from SEM and TEM images. Further analysis on TEM images was carried out. The gray value intensity profile was derived from TEM images in order to determine the specific pattern of this unique morphology that is found to be clearly different from that of other types of porous spherical-like morphologies. On the basis of these results, the KCC-1 morphology would be more appropriately reclassified as bicontinuous concentric lamellar morphology. Some physical characteristics such as the origin of emulsion, electrical conductivity, and the local structure of water molecules in the KCC-1 emulsion were disclosed to reveal the formation mechanism of KCC-1. The origin of the KCC-1 emulsion was characterized by the observation of the Tyndall effect, conductometry to determine the critical micelle concentration, and Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the morphological evolution study during KCC-1 synthesis completes the portrait of the formation of mesoporous silica KCC-1.},

We carried out a series of photometric observations of the Karin family asteroids, and here we report on the analysis of the lightcurves including the rotation period of eleven members. The mean rotation rate of the Karin family members turned out to be much lower than those of near-Earth asteroids or small main belt asteroids (diameter D {\textless} 12 km), and even lower than that of large main belt asteroids (D {\textgreater} 130 km). We investigated a correlation between the peak-to-trough variation and the rotation period of the eleven Karin family asteroids, and found a possible trend that elongated members have lower spin rates, and less elongated members have higher spin rates.

	abstract = {The low-temperature synthesis of zeolite ZSM-5 below 100°C is gaining new attention. This is due to the fact that such synthesis may simultaneously implement the introduction of mesopores into crystalline microporous zeolite structure. Herein, we report the use of natural silica precursors from rice husks in the mesoporogen-free synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 below 100°C and their structural properties which govern the course of crystallization. Rice husks are agricultural wastes with high silica content, which should be exploited to give a positive impact, i.e. highly value-added materials. In this study, the amorphous silica from rice husks was extracted using sequential base-acid treatment. The extracted silica was similarly reactive as Ludox HS-40, even with the reduced amounts of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA). The product was highly crystalline ZSM-5 with spherical morphology composed of small crystallites, enabling the presence of intercrystallite mesopores. The subjection of extracted silica into the calcination at 550°C for 6h, prior to the low-temperature synthesis, altered the silica structure via hydroxyl condensation. The distinct structural properties affected the occurring crystallization in which the resulted products were ZSM-5–disordered-mesoporous silica composites. The possible mechanisms of these two different results may involve the dual roles of tetrapropylammonium ion (TPA+) as zeolite OSDA and non-templating structure directing agent. These insights were based on the spectroscopic (FTIR, Raman, 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy), microscopic (TEM and HRTEM) and physicochemical characterizations (XRD and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm).},

	abstract = {The molecular diffusion with zeolites is somewhat limited, particularly for bulky molecules because zeolites only have micropores, which, in turn, limit their use as catalysts. Generation of hierarchically porous ZSM-5 with micro and mesopores has been a rational solution for overcoming this problem. The conventional method for synthesizing hierarchically porous ZSM-5 generally requires high-temperature heating in the presence of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) and a mesopore-generating agent (mesoporogen). Herein, we report a new method for the synthesis of hierarchically porous ZSM-5, which leads to the synthesis at low temperature in the presence of a reduced amount of OSDA and in the absence of any mesoporogen. The OSDA seems to play an additional role as a scaffolding agent for mesopore generation. Our study also showed that the control of the molar composition is essential for the crystallization of hierarchically porous-ZSM-5.},

However, few studies have investigated enhancements of the ON/OFF current ratio as a function of the electron spin behavior. Here, we found a significantly high spin-dependent current ratio—more than 102 at 1.5 V—when changing the relative direction of the magnetizations between FePt nanodots (NDs) and the CoPtCr-coated atomic force microscope (AFM) probe at room temperature. This means that ON and OFF states were achieved by switching the magnetization of the FePt NDs, which can be regarded as spin-diodes. The FePt magnetic NDs were fabricated by exposing a bi-layer metal stack to a remote H2 plasma (H2-RP) on {\textasciitilde}1.7 nm SiO2/Si(100) substrates. The ultrathin bi-layers with a uniform surface coverage are changed drastically to NDs with an areal density as high as {\textasciitilde}5 × 1011 cm−2. The FePt NDs exhibit a large perpendicular anisotropy with an out-of-plane coercivity of {\textasciitilde}4.8 kOe, reflecting the magneto-crystalline anisotropy of (001) oriented L10 phase FePt. We also designed and fabricated double-stacked FePt-NDs with low and high coercivities sandwiched between an ultra-thin Si-oxide interlayer, and confirmed a high ON/OFF current ratio when switching the relative magnetization directions of the low and high coercivity FePt NDs.},

	abstract = {The absence of organic structure directing agent (OSDA) in the synthesis of zeolite has shown progress recently, nevertheless the formation mechanism is still not clearly understood and the technique cannot be fully generalized for the synthesis of various types of zeolite frameworks. In this research, the drastic reduction of OSDA in the synthesis of ZSM-5 employing the steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) was studied. The used tetrapropylammonium bromide as OSDA in the synthesis of ZSM-5 was one-fifth and one-twentieth of typical amount reported in literature. Upon OSDA reduction, the crystallization leads to the formation of ZSM-5 with hierarchical pore structure revealed by SEM and TEM images in which it is different compared to the parent spherical-like crystal morphology of ZSM-5 synthesized without reducing the OSDA amounts. A quantitative analysis of the X-ray diffractograms suggests that 100\% crystallinity could not be achieved in the sample synthesized under the OSDA reduction confirming that the orientation of crystal growth is not similar to the conventional coffin-type ZSM-5 crystal. The deviancy in crystal growth is further associated with the formation of mesopores originated from severe defect planes of ZSM-5. On the verge of gradual disappearance, a broadened distribution of mesoporosity could return the crystallinity to 100\% in which faulty elongated crystal shape, close to typical coffin-type growth orientation appeared as the product after commencing the Oswald ripening of longer period of synthesis time. The conventional hydrothermal synthesis may not be used for crystallizing ZSM-5 when the OSDA was one-twentieth of typical starting amount making the SAC to be an appropriate technique for synthesizing ZSM-5 under drastically reduced OSDA, in particular to simultaneously perform the hierarchically porous zeolite.},

N2 physisorption confirmed the mesoporous structure with a pore diameter of 3.38 nm. 27Al NMR showed the presence of framework and extra-framework aluminum structures, which led to the formation of strong Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites. HAlMSN catalyzed the synthesis of (E)-chalcones through the Claisen–Schmidt reaction. Chalcone derivatives have been applied as biologically active compounds with anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and diuretic pharmacological activities. The products were obtained via reactions on the protonic acid sites of HAlMSN. The significant advantages of this reaction are high yield, easy work up, short reaction time and also compatibility with various organic solvents. The products were obtained in an excellent conversion of 97\% at 298 K. The results show that the electron donating substituents exhibit higher conversion in comparison to electron withdrawing substituents. The stability of the catalyst was investigated by reusing it five times for (E)-chalcone production and there was only a slight decrease in its catalytic activity. The highest product of (E)-chalcone was observed with a 1 : 2 molar ratio of benzaldehyde/acetophenone. A comparative study in chalcone synthesis using the heterogeneous catalysts demonstrated that HAlMSN has a significantly high activity at low temperature.},

Here, the kinetics of nitrogen-doped CD (N-CD) formation by hydrothermal synthesis were evaluated in an attempt to realize the rapid and efficient production of N-CDs. A series of N-CDs was synthesized using various heating rates, reaction times, reaction temperatures, and precursor concentrations. Characterization of the series of N-CDs indicated that N-CD formation is a first-order reaction with a reaction rate constant of 0.634 min−1. In addition, systematic investigation revealed that synthesis temperature is a more important factor to obtain highly fluorescent N-CDs than reaction time. Citric acid amides are formed by the reaction between citric acid and urea at 130 °C and N-CDs consisting of two or three citric acid amide molecules are formed through dehydration, deammoniation and dehydrogenation of citric acid at 150 °C. By adjusting the operating conditions, N-CDs with a highest quantum yield of 39.7\% could be produced at a production rate of 50 g h−1 with a reaction time of 16 min. The N-CDs were then embedded in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers. The luminescence intensity of the N-CD–PVA composite nanofibers was more than twice that of the N-CDs in solution.},

We investigate the evolution of binary star clusters with different orbital configurations, with a particular focus on the Galactic tidal field. We carry out N-body simulations of evolving binary star clusters and compare our results with estimates from our semi-analytic model. The latter accounts for mass-loss due to stellar evolution and two-body relaxation, and for evolution due to external tides. Using the semi-analytic model, we predict the long-term evolution for a wide range of initial conditions. It accurately describes the global evolution of such systems, until the moment when a cluster merger is imminent. N-body simulations are used to test our semi-analytic model and also to study additional features of evolving binary clusters, such as the kinematics of stars, global cluster rotation, evaporation rates, and the cluster merger process. We find that the initial orientation of a binary star cluster with respect to the Galactic field, and also the initial orbital phase, is crucial for its fate. Depending on these properties, the binaries may experience orbital reversal, spiral-in, or vertical oscillation about the Galactic plane before they actually merge at t ≈ 100 Myr, and produce rotating star clusters with slightly higher evaporation rates. The merger process of a binary cluster induces an outburst that ejects ∼10 per cent of the stellar members into the Galactic field.},

Additionally, we observed that a model of a solar cell made using a composite of TiO2 and graphite as the active material had much higher efficiency than solar cells made using TiO2- or graphite-only active materials. Although the highest efficiency we report here is approximately 1 \%, our proposed solar cell structure is promising for mass application, especially in low-income settings, owing to its easy and flexible fabrication, and easy large-scale application.},

In general, each trajectory is discussed separately in university physics textbooks for undergraduate students. In this work, a solution of a charged particle moving in a uniform electric field at right angles to a uniform magnetic field (uniform crossed electric and magnetic fields) is reported; it is limited to particle motion in a plane. Specific solutions and their trajectories are obtained only by varying the initial particle velocity. The result shows five basic trajectory patterns, i.e., straight line, sinusoid-like, cycloid, cycloid-like with oscillation, and circle-like. The region of each trajectory is also mapped in the initial velocity space of the particle. This paper is intended for undergraduate students and describes further the trajectories of a charged particle through the regions of electric and magnetic fields influenced by initial condition of the particle, where electromagnetic radiation of an accelerated particle is not considered.},

The controller synthesis for the local linear systems is then formulated in the bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) problem. After that, the BMIs problem is reduced to an equivalent parameter of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) problem which has a feasible solution.

	abstract = {Studies pertaining to heat flow density distribution in Indonesian tertiary sedimentary basins have been conducted intermittently throughout more than two decades. Even so, all of these studies have always concentrated on the basic compilations of thermal gradient, thermal conductivity, and terrestrial heat flow datasets or the study of basin thermal history rather than on the investigations into their present thermal regime. In addition, syntheses on the possible causes to the observed heat flow density distribution in these basins have been largely determined only on the basis of its correlation with geological and geophysical evidences. One basin experiencing this particular problem is the onshore Northwest Java Basin, where knowledge of the present-day subsurface temperature structure is virtually absent and interpretation of heat flow distribution has been mainly qualitative. For these reasons, in this study we have attempted to quantitatively characterize the present subsurface temperature distribution and surface heat flow density of the onshore Northwest Java Basin using a simple numerical thermal modeling approach, based on the most recent heat flow datasets. Taking into account a conductive heat transfer process, the modeling exercise is aimed at deriving a 3-D subsurface temperature distribution. The temperature distribution is translated into the predicted surface heat flow distribution. The modeled temperature field reveals its dependence on the geometrical aspects of the basin’s basement. Comparison between the computed and the observed heat flow densities, taking into account the uncertainties of both, suggests that advective heat transport by groundwater flow may be present, in addition to conduction. The modeling results are thus capable of demonstrating the importance of a quantitative approach in studying the present thermal state of a sedimentary basin.},

	abstract = {BackgroundNowadays, biodiesel has become more attractive in the quest for a novel fuel source due to its environmental benefits and the biodegradable properties. Transesterification of Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seeds oil is one of methodsacci for producing biodiesel fuel. However, during this process, the impurities are frequently found in the synthesized biodiesel which degrades the quality of biodiesel. Therefore, a proper catalyst is required to obtain the high-quality biodiesel. In this study, a series of aminated polyethersulfone (PES-{\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{NH\}\_2{\textbackslash})) membranes was prepared as solid support for immobilized Mucor miehei lipase. Glutaraldehyde was used as a cross-linker agent in immobilization process to investigate the effect of spacer toward biodiesel production.ResultsBased on elemental analysis, lipase was successfully attached onto PES-{\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{NH\}\_2{\textbackslash}) membranes and formed physical interactions. Enzyme loading values of synthesized membrane were higher than that of commercial filtration membrane. LC-MS analysis with C18 as a column showed that butyl palmitate, butyl linoleate, and butyl oleate were produced from transesterification reaction of triglyceride from sunflower oil and butanol. Based on FTIR analysis, the imine group as a covalent bond was successfully obtained during the cross-linking reaction. After reaction with the spacer, the enzyme loading was increased significantly from 177.05 to 911.48 μg/cm{\textbackslash}({\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}). The alkyl esters produced also showed high values after the cross-linking. According to biodiesel quality tests, the results were matched with the values specified by the ASTM.ConclusionBiodiesel from sunflower seeds oil was successfully synthesized through a transesterification reaction catalyzed by Mucor miehei lipase immobilized onto the synthesized aminated PES membrane. The addition of glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker showed an excellent enzyme loading value and led to significantly increased biodiesel conversion efficiency. This method is good to be developed, since the immobilized enzyme stability could be increased, the separation process was easier, and a high yield with good quality of biodiesel could be obtained.Open image in new windowGraphical abstractThe synthesis of biodiesel catalyzed by Mucor miehei lipase immobilized onto aminated polyethersulfone membranes.},

An abundant amount of nutrients as a result of waste decomposition increases the number of microalgae populations present in the pond of the wastewater treatment plant, thereby causing a population explosion of microalgae, also called algal blooming. In a stabilization pond system, the presence of algal blooming is not desirable because it can decrease wastewater treatment performance. More knowledge about the relationship between the nutrients concentration and algae blooming conditions, such as microalgae diversity, is needed to control and maintain the performance of the wastewater treatment plant. Therefore this study was conducted, in order to reveal the diversity of microalgae in the stabilization pond system and its relationship with the water characteristics of the comprising ponds. The results showed that the water quality in the stabilization pond system of Bojongsoang WWTP supported rapid growth of microalgae, where most rapid microbial growth occurred in the anaerobic pond. The microalgae diversity in the stabilization ponds was very high, with various morphologies, probably affiliated with blue-green algae, green algae, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates and diatoms. This study has successfully produced information on microalgae diversity and abundance profiles in a stabilization pond system.},

Finally, the Fe3O4-chitosan hybrid nano-particles were used for the adsorption of humic acid (HA) from aqueous solutions using batch adsorption technique. The influences of contact time, pH, adsorbent dosages, initial concentration of HA and temperatures on the adsorption process were studied. The adsorption isotherms were better fitted by Langmuir isotherm with the adsorption capacity was found to be 44.84mg/g. The results of the kinetic study showed that the adsorption of HA onto Fe3O4-chitosan hybrid nano-particles could be described by the pseudo second order kinetic model with a rate constant in the range of 0.032–0.104gmg−1min−1, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters data indicated that the HA adsorption process was non spontaneous and endothermic under the experimental conditions, with the values of Gibbs free energy (ΔGo) were in the range of 2.92–4.65kJ/mol; as well as the values of enthalpy (ΔHo), entropy (ΔSo) and the activation energy (Ea) were found to be 21.80kJ/mol, 57.55J/mol and 19.27kJ/mol, respectively. The computational chemistry study showed that the interaction between adsorbent and HA was occurred through the interaction between amine groups of chitosan and phenol groups of HA.

The inhibition tests were carried out using the methods of weight loss (WL) and linear polarization (LP). Characterization using MALDI-TOF MS revealed that the oligomer has the mass (m/z) in the range 200-2400, which corresponds to chain length of 2-22 repeating units. The results of corrosion rate measurements show that the corrosion rate with the use of oligomer is significantly lower than that without inhibitor, demonstrating that the oligomer functioned as effective corrosion inhibitor, while the 4-vinyl pyridine monomer was found to promote the corrosion.

	abstract = {We study the effect of density distribution evolution on the global one-armed oscillation modes in low-viscosity discs around isolated and binary Be stars. Observations show that some Be stars exhibit evidence of formation and dissipation of the equatorial disc. In this paper, we first calculate the density evolution in discs around isolated Be stars. To model the formation stage of the disc, we inject mass at a radius just outside the star at a constant rate for 30–50 yr. As the disc develops, the density distribution approaches the form of the steady disc solution. Then, we turn-off the mass injection to model the disc dissipation stage. The innermost part of the disc starts accretion, and a gap forms between the star and the disc. Next, we calculate the one-armed modes at several epochs. We neglect the effect of viscosity because the time-scale of oscillations is much shorter than the disc evolution time-scale for low viscosity. In the disc formation stage, the eigenfrequency increases with time towards the value for the steady state disc. On the other hand, one-armed eigenmodes in dissipating Be discs have significantly higher eigenfrequencies and narrower propagation regions. Observationally, such a change of mode characteristics can be taken as an evidence for gap opening around the star. In binary Be stars, the characteristics of the disc evolution and the eigenmodes are qualitatively the same as in isolated Be stars, but quantitatively, they have shorter evolution time-scales and higher eigenfrequencies, which is in agreement with the observed trend.},

	abstract = {A study is performed on a photonic-state mixing-pattern in an insulator-metal-insulator cylindrical silver nanoshell and its rich variations induced by changes in the geometry and dielectric media of the system, representing the combined influences of plasmon coupling strength and cavity effects. This study is performed in terms of the photonic local density of states (LDOS) calculated using the Green tensor method, in order to elucidate those combined effects. The energy profiles of LDOS inside the dielectric core are shown to exhibit consistently growing number of redshifted photonic states due to an enhanced plasmon coupling induced state mixing arising from decreased shell thickness, increased cavity size effect, and larger symmetry breaking effect induced by increased permittivity difference between the core and the background media. Further, an increase in cavity size leads to increased additional peaks that spread out toward the lower energy regime. A systematic analysis of those variations for a silver nanoshell with a fixed inner radius in vacuum background reveals a certain pattern of those growing number of redshifted states with an analytic expression for the corresponding energy downshifts, signifying a photonic state mixing scheme beyond the commonly adopted plasmon hybridization scheme. Finally, a remarkable correlation is demonstrated between the LDOS energy profiles outside the shell and the corresponding scattering efficiencies.},

Raman spectra of HoVO 3 and YVO 3 unveil similar features since both compounds have nearly identical R-radii. However, the most important difference lies in the transition temperature involving the V 3+ orbitals, the V 3+ magnetic moments as well as the crystallographic structure. Particularly, the magnetic and orbital reorientations occur at T N 2 = 40 K for HoVO 3 instead T N 2 =77 K in the case of YVO 3 . For both systems, anomalous phonon shifts which are related to spin-phonon coupling are observed below the V 3+ magnetic ordering temperature ( T N 1 ≈ 110 K) while additional phonon anomalies are exclusively observed in HoVO 3 around T * ≈ 15 K. On the other hand, infrared (IR) transmittance measurements as a function of temperature reveal Ho 3+5 I 8 → 5 I 7 excitations and additional excitations assigned as vibronics. These latter combined with drastic changes in Ho 3+5 I 8 → 5 I 7 excitations at T N 2 , are indicative of a strong coupling between the Ho 3+ ions and the ligand field. This could explain the large magnetocaloric capacity shown by HoVO 3 .},

The physical parameters such as polaron radius, field strength and inter nuclear distance have been determined from measurements of densities and refractive indices. The structural properties of the prepared borate glasses were analyzed based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR instruments. The diffraction spectra show no characteristic peaks in these glasses, which indicates the amorphous nature of the glasses. The infrared spectrum of the Eu3+-doped sodium-lead-zinc-lithium-borate glass systems show three disparate regions for active absorption band around 830–860 cm−1, 1020–1040 cm−1 and 1170–1180 cm−1. The electronic transitions in the UV–vis and NIR regions are assigned to the 7F0 → 5D4, 7F0 → 5G2, 7F0 → 5L6, 7F0 → 5D3, 7F0 → 5D2, 7F0 → 5D1, 7F0 → 5D0 7F1 → 5D0 7F0 → 7F6 and 7F1 → 7F6 levels centered at 362 nm, 380 nm, 395 nm, 414 nm, 465 nm, 533 nm, 583 nm, 590 nm 2092 nm and 2202 nm respectively.

The luminescence intensity ratio (R) of 5D0 → 7F2 (electric dipole) transition to 5D0 → 7F1 (magnetic dipole) transition has been determined to obtain the strength of the covalent/ionic bond between the Eu3+ ions and the surrounding ligands. Radiative life time and emission color of the glasses were estimated and compared with other literature data by varying Eu3+ concentrations. The experimental lifetime of the 5D0 level was found to increase with increasing Eu3+ ion content, suggesting higher non-radiative energy transfer among Eu3+ ions in the glasses.},

The coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometry, and nanoindentation. The XRD analysis in 2θ-range of 30°–42° revealed that the coatings exhibited low crystallinity of CoCu2O3, CoCuO2, and CuCoO2. The surface bonding structure analyzed using XPS indicated that the coating contained: Cu (tetrahedral Cu+ and octahedral Cu2+), Co (octahedral Co3+, tetrahedral Co2+, and mixed Co2+ and Co3+), and O (lattice, surface, and sub-surface oxygens).
The optical properties characterized using UV-Vis-NIR showed that the reflectance spectra of coatings formed a spectrally solar selective absorber profile associated with the interference peaks and the absorption edges around wavelengths of below 1.2 μm. The maximum absorptance (α = 75.8\%) was shown by coating synthesized at 500 °C. The mechanical properties of coatings showed that the increase of annealing temperature increased the coating's hardness (H) and the elastic modulus (E) due to the enhancement of the [CoCuO2/CuCoO2]:[CoCu2O3] oxide phases ratio, as the result, an excellent stability of the wear resistance (H/E) of around ∼0.035 was recorded.},

	abstract = {This research aims to examine an application of the natural product mini project laboratory in order to improve the students’ conceptual understanding. This research was carried out by using quasi-experimental methods. Participants consisted of 31 students of chemistry education department (experimental class) and 28 students of chemistry department (control class) at 6th semester academic year 2012/2013 from one of state university in the West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Experimental class used natural product mini project laboratory model (NP-MPLM) and control class used verification laboratory model. Research results showed that students used the natural product mini project laboratory more conceptual understanding than the students used verification laboratory. The average N-gain of conceptual understanding for experiment class was 0.56 while for the control class was 0.34. The highest N-gain in the experimental class was 0.73 for UV spectroscopy concept while the smallest N-Gain was 0.34 for thin layer chromatography concept. Before the application of the natural product laboratory mini project, the highest percentage of misconception in the experimental class occurred in metabolites category (44.09\%) and the highest percentage of do not know the concept occurred in UV spectroscopy (59.68\%). After the application of the natural product mini project laboratory, the highest percentage of misconceptions occurred in separation of chemical components (35.48\%) and the highest percentage of do not know the concept occurred in NMR spectroscopy (29.03\%)},

	abstract = {A high temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR) has been developed and constructed by Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) since 1990s. The standard HTTR has been designed for helium coolant with thermal energy output of 30 MW. HTTR uses graphite as the moderator with outlet coolant temperature of 950 °C. Instead of the pebble-bed type of fuel, the prismatic block fuel type with low enriched UO2 has been employed in this reactor. In this study we have performed comparative evaluations on plutonium oxide utilization in uranium fuel cycle of HTTR with helium gas and carbon dioxide gas coolants. The cell-burnup calculations have been performed by using a SRAC 2006 code, with the nuclear data library was derived from JENDL3.3. The 3-dimensional calculations were performed by employing a CITATION code. The results show that the reactor can achieve its criticality condition if the plutonium concentration in the loaded fuel is 5.0\% or higher for both coolant materials.},

	abstract = {Design study on heavy water cooled thorium breeding reactor has been investigated by adopting a nuclear equilibrium state model. Conversion ratio, as an important index, has been evaluated to estimate the breeding capability of the reactors. Void reactivity coefficient has also been investigated to evaluate performance index of safety aspect, which is based on the criticality performance of the reactors during voided condition. In addition, moderator-to-fuel ratio has also been employed to analyze its effect to the required enrichment, conversion ratio, and void reactivity coefficient as well as different burnups and fuel pin diameter effects. Void reactivity coefficient indicates a criticality condition of the reactor when some coolants are lost. If the negative value of void reactivity is achieved, it means that the reactor has less reactivity condition as well as less power production when lost of coolant occurred. Higher fuel conversion capability, that more nuclear fuel are produced, those additional fuel productions can be used for next operation or for other reactors. The results show that higher fuel conversion ratio can be achieved for less moderator-to-fuel ratio because of the harder neutron spectrum effect, while it requires more fissile content of 233U to maintain the reactor operation from fission reaction. Higher burnup gives less conversion ratio because some fissile materials are used to maintain longer reactor operation, and at the same time, it requires more initial required fissile 233U for higher burnup. In addition, it requires less fissile 233U for thicker fuel pin diameter, while its conversion ratio becomes higher, and void reactivity coefficient is more negative for thicker fuel pin diameter. The results also show that thorium utilization on heavy water cooled reactor gives all negative void reactivity values, which means that the system has a safety condition in terms of void reactivity condition. At the same time, it shows some feasible conditions for obtaining fuel breeding to increase the sustainability of nuclear fuel. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this study the preliminary analysis of start-up process of modified CANDLE burn-up scheme based long life Pb-Bi Cooled Fast Reactors has been performed. The basic strategy is to put different plutonium content in each core regions by considering its equilibrium plutonium content in each region. The system then is started as a Modified CANDLE reactor system until relatively stable cycle obtained. The calculation has been done by using SLAROM, SRAC, and FI-ITB CH1 system codes. Two dimensional multi-group diffusion and burn-up calculation has been adopted during simulation. As results, the start-up scheme of several Modified CANDLE core with power level of 1150-1350 MWt have been performed. In this case LWR plutonium is used to initiate the MCANDLE reactors.

Many research has been conducted to examine feasibility of thorium fuel. In this present study, burnable poison feasibility on combined thorium-uranium based fuel for long life PWR at thermal power output 800 MWt has been conducted. Fuel of this reactor design has implemented ThO2 combined by 40 – 60\% enriched UO2 in an acceptable enrichment (13-20 \% U-235). To reach long life operation time, fuel volume fraction examination varied for 40-60 \%. Burnable poison on this design has been evaluated for 0.005-0.06 \% Gd2O3, 0.5-2 \% Pa-231, and 0.5-2 \% Np- 237. Gd2O3 has very high thermal neutron absorption cross section, small amount of relatively sufficient to reduce excess reactivity, but the effect of this material only work in early burnup step. Np-237 has 190 barns thermal neutron capture cross section which can be used to minimize excess reactivity. Pa-231 has higher thermal neutron capture cross section (280 barns) rather than Np-237 (190 barns), hence the effect of Pa-231 stronger than Np-237 for minimize excess reactivity. In the other side, Pa-231 could compensate fissile isotope in the further burnup step. The optimized design of this study reached 10 years operation time with excess reactivity smaller than 2.5\% dk/k.},

	abstract = {The use of parameters water equivalent diameter (DW) and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) are becoming increasingly established as a recognised method to relate patient dose from a CT examination to the dose indicator volume CT dose index (CTDIVOL). However, the role of the attenuation due to the patient table in these estimations requires careful consideration and is the subject of this study. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of a minimal part of the patient table when calculating the DW and SSDE. We investigated 164 patients who had undergone CT examinations for the pelvis, abdomen, thorax and head. We subsequently calculated DW and SSDE using two methods: one using a small circular region of interest (ROI) including a minimal part of the patient table and the other using a ROI fitted to the patient border alone. The results showed that the water equivalent diameter calculated with the table included in the ROI (DW,t) is greater, compared to that without the consideration of the patient table (DW,nt), by 1.5–6.2\% depending on the anatomy being imaged. On the other hand, the SSDE calculated with inclusion of the patient table (SSDEt) is smaller than otherwise (SSDEnt) by 1.0–5.5\% again depending on the anatomy being imaged. The effect of the patient table on DW and SSDE in the thorax CT examination was statistically significant, but its effect on DW and SSDE in the other examinations of head, pelvis and abdomen was relatively small and not statistically significant.},

	abstract = {PurposeTo investigate the feasibility of differential geometry features in the detection of anatomical feature points on a patient surface in infrared-ray-based range images in image-guided radiation therapy.MethodsThe key technology was to reconstruct the patient surface in the range image, i.e., point distribution with three-dimensional coordinates, and characterize the geometrical shape at every point based on curvature features. The region of interest on the range image was extracted by using a template matching technique, and the range image was processed for reducing temporal and spatial noise. Next, a mathematical smooth surface of the patient was reconstructed from the range image by using a non-uniform rational B-splines model. The feature points were detected based on curvature features computed on the reconstructed surface. The framework was tested on range images acquired by a time-of-flight (TOF) camera and a Kinect sensor for two surface (texture) types of head phantoms A and B that had different anatomical geometries. The detection accuracy was evaluated by measuring the residual error, i.e., the mean of minimum Euclidean distances (MMED) between reference (ground truth) and detected feature points on convex and concave regions.ResultsThe MMEDs obtained using convex feature points for range images of the translated and rotated phantom A were 1.79±0.531.79±0.531.79 {\textbackslash}pm 0.53 and 1.97±0.21mm1.97±0.21mm1.97{\textbackslash}pm 0.21{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}hbox \{mm\}, respectively, using the TOF camera. For the phantom B, the MMEDs of the convex and concave feature points were 0.26±0.090.26±0.090.26{\textbackslash}pm 0.09 and 0.52±0.120.52±0.120.52{\textbackslash}pm 0.12 mm, respectively, using the Kinect sensor. There was a statistically significant difference in the decreased MMED for convex feature points compared with concave feature points (P{\textless}0.001)(P{\textless}0.001)(P{\textless}0.001).ConclusionsThe proposed framework has demonstrated the feasibility of differential geometry features for the detection of anatomical feature points on a patient surface in range image-guided radiation therapy.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to accurately and effectively automate the calculation of the water-equivalent diameter (DW) from 3D CT images for estimating the size-specific dose. DW is the metric that characterizes the patient size and attenuation. In this study, DW was calculated for standard CTDI phantoms and patient images. Two types of phantom were used, one representing the head with a diameter of 16 cm and the other representing the body with a diameter of 32 cm. Images of 63 patients were also taken, 32 who had undergone a CT head examination and 31 who had undergone a CT thorax examination. There are three main parts to our algorithm for automated DW calculation. The first part is to read 3D images and convert the CT data into Hounsfield units (HU). The second part is to find the contour of the phantoms or patients automatically. And the third part is to automate the calculation of DW based on the automated contouring for every slice (DW,all). The results of this study show that the automated calculation of DW and the manual calculation are in good agreement for phantoms and patients. The differences between the automated calculation of DW and the manual calculation are less than 0.5\%. The results of this study also show that the estimating of DW,all using DW,n=1 (central slice along longitudinal axis) produces percentage differences of −0.92\%±3.37\% and 6.75\%±1.92\%, and estimating DW,all using DW,n=9 produces percentage differences of 0.23\%±0.16\% and 0.87\%±0.36\%, for thorax and head examinations, respectively. From this study, the percentage differences between normalized size-specific dose estimate for every slice (nSSDEall) and nSSDEn=1 are 0.74\%±2.82\% and −4.35\%±1.18\% for thorax and head examinations, respectively; between nSSDEall and nSSDEn=9 are 0.00\%±0.46\% and −0.60\%±0.24\% for thorax and head examinations, respectively.

	abstract = {Protein hydrolysis enables production of peptides and free amino acids that are suitable for usage in food and feed or can be used as precursors for bulk chemicals. Several essential amino acids for food and feed have hydrophobic side chains; this property may also be exploited for subsequent separation. Here, we present methods for selective production of hydrophobic amino acids from proteins. Selectivity can be achieved by selection of starting material, selection of hydrolysis conditions, and separation of achieved hydrolysate. Several protease combinations were applied for hydrolysis of rubber seed protein concentrate, wheat gluten, and bovine serum albumin (BSA). High degree of hydrolysis ({\textgreater}50 \%) could be achieved. Hydrophobic selectivity was influenced by the combination of proteases and by the extent of hydrolysis. Combination of Pronase and Peptidase R showed the highest selectivity towards hydrophobic amino acids, roughly doubling the content of hydrophobic amino acids in the products compared to the original substrates. Hydrophobic selectivity of 0.6 mol-hydrophobic/mol-total free amino acids was observed after 6 h hydrolysis of wheat gluten and 24 h hydrolysis of rubber seed proteins and BSA. The results of experiments with rubber seed proteins and wheat gluten suggest that this process can be applied to agro-industrial residues.},

The changes of various bond length of atoms around the vacancies area about 0.051 A0smaller or 0.1 A0 larger than the original C-C bond length.

	abstract = {Big bang theory states that universe emerged from singularity with very high temperature and density, then expands homogeneously and isotropically. This theory gives rise standard cosmological principle which declares that universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. However, universe is not perfectly homogeneous and isotropic on small scales. There exist structures starting from clusters, galaxies even to stars and planetary system scales. Cosmological perturbation theory is a fundamental theory that explains the origin of structures. According to this theory, the structures can be regarded as small perturbations in the early universe, which evolves as the universe expands. In addition to the problem of inhomogeneities of the universe, observations of supernovae Ia suggest that our universe is being accelerated. Various models of dark energy have been proposed to explain cosmic acceleration, one of them is cosmological constant. Because of several problems arise from cosmological constant, the alternative models have been proposed, one of these models is quintessence. We reconstruct growth of structure model following quintessence scenario at several epochs of the universe, which is specified by the effective equation of state parameters for each stage. Discussion begins with the dynamics of quintessence, in which exponential potential is analytically derived, which leads to various conditions of the universe. We then focus on scaling and quintessence dominated solutions. Subsequently, we review the basics of cosmological perturbation theory and derive formulas to investigate how matter perturbation evolves with time in subhorizon scales which leads to structure formation, and also analyze the influence of quintessence to the structure formation. From analytical exploration, we obtain the growth rate of matter perturbation and the existence of quintessence as a dark energy that slows down the growth of structure formation of the universe.},

	abstract = {From optical observations, Blazar OJ 287 is known to exhibit periodic outbursts. A model of Binary Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) in the center of OJ 287 is used to explain the phenomenon of 12-year periodic outbursts. Multiwavelength observations confirm outbursts of OJ 287 in several bands, one of them is in the X-ray band. X-ray spectra of OJ 287 from X-ray observations in 2005 to 2016 were analyzed to determine the variability in X-ray. Spectral data were obtained from X-ray Imaging Spectrometers (XIS) from Suzaku mission and X-ray Telescope (XRT) mission from Swift. Energy intervals of the X-ray spectra are 0.4 – 10 keV for Suzaku/XIS and 0.3 – 7 keV for Swift/XRT. The data were divided into several non-outburst and outburst data groups. In general, power law model is considered the most appropriate model and it is also confirmed that the X-ray spectra of OJ 287 during that period exhibit fluctuation in photon index value, Γ. Variability of the value of Γ indicates that there is evolution of the X-ray spectra of OJ 287 during the non-outburst phase and also during the transitions between non-outburst and outburst phase and vice versa. Different values of Γ are also found during different outburst phases. In general, the derived values of Γ are in agreement with the inverse Compton process (Γ ∼1 – 2), in contrast with the synchrotron process (Γ ∼2 – 3). We also found that Γ increases as the flux increases, as opposed to synchrotron process. In addition, X-ray luminosity of OJ 287 shows fluctuation within {\textasciitilde}1011 ≤ L⊙ ≤ 1012. The X-ray light curve was made and compared with an optical light curve to investigate the correlation of outbursts time in both bands.},

LBE is very corrosive to stainless steel by formation of oxide layer or elemental dissolution, e.g. Ni. Thus, new type of bellows for bellows-sealed valve made of nickel free material, i.e. YUS409D, is proposed to be used in the LBE. Bellows material undergo heat treatments for mechanical improvement including cold working and annealing. The thickness reduction by the heat treatments is about 90\% of initial condition. Corrosion behavior of the bellows has been studied in stagnant LBE at 500 and 600 °C for 500 hours. The oxygen concentration was controlled at about 10 −7 wt\%. Typical oxide layers were developed on the surface. Oxidation rate was sharply increased at 600°C.},

Hence, it is important to clarify the relations composition-structure, also on a local-scale level. The aim of this contribution is to give further insights into the effect of A - and B -site cations to the room-temperature local structure of Aurivillius four-layered A Bi 4 Ti 4 O 15 ( A = Sr, Pb, Ba) and Pb 1− x Bi 4+ x Ti 4− x Mn x O 15 ( x = 0, 0.2, 0.4) by Raman scattering. The effect of A -site cation to the local structure of perovskite block was identified by the phonon mode near 750 and 870 cm −1 arising from B O 6 stretching. A -site Ba 2+ , having the largest ionic radius among the considered elements, significantly stiffens the TiO 6 octahedra, as derived from the fact that the TiO 6 stretching modes have the highest wavenumber for BaBi 4 Ti 4 O 15 , i.e. the Ti-O bond strength is strongest for this compound. The replacement of Ti 4+ by Mn 3+ cation at the B - site also influences the B -O bond. The comparison of the phonon modes near 700 and 870 cm −1 in Pb 1− x Bi 4+ x Ti 4− x Mn x O 15 with x = 0, 0.2, and 0.4 shows that the lowest wavenumber, which is due to the elongation of Ti-O bonds is observed for x = 0.4.},

The HIPS solutions were made with a single solvent (DMF or d-limonene), a mixed solvent (d-limonene/DMF), and with the addition of acetone to the previously stated solvents. The effects of HIPS concentration, a mix of solvent, and the addition of acetone on the morphology and the diameter of fibers were observed. The morphological change from particles to fibers took place along with the increasing concentration of HIPS in d-limonene. For other precursor solutions using DMF solvent, bead free fibers could be obtained even at low levels. The average diameter of fibers increased along with the increase of the HIPS concentration in DMF. At the concentrations of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 wt.\%, the average diameters were 1.85, 2.09, 2.66, 3.59, and 7.38 μm, respectively. For the precursor solutions with the combination of different solvents (HIPS/DMF), the existence of beads was influenced by the ratio of solvents. When the ratio of d-limonene/DMF was 75:25, the obtained beaded fibers had a relatively large amount of beads. At the ratio of 50:50, fewer beads were found. Bead-free fibers were finally reached when the ratio of HIPS / DMF was 25:75. The addition of acetone reduced the diameter of the produced fibers. However, too much addition of acetone caused the fibers to be wet. Additionally, the diameter became larger if the addition of acetone surpassed a certain amount of volume.},

The precursor solution was the mixture of ethanolic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with a molecular weight of 1,300 kg/mol and ethanolic GTE solutions at a weight concentration of 4 wt.\% and 2 wt.\%, respectively, and it was estimated that the entanglement number was 2. The electrospraying was conducted at the voltage of 15 kV, the flow rate of 10 µL/min., and the distance between the collector and the tip of the nozzle of 10 cm. The SEM images showed that the PVP/GTE nanostructures had a combination of agglomerated beads (less spherical particles) and nanofibers. This occurred because if the PVP concentration is low, the PVP/GTE composite has weak core structures that cause the shell to be easily agglomerated each other. The intermolecular interaction between PVP and GTE in the PVP/GTE nanostructures occurred as confirmed by the peak at 3396 cm -1 , which is the carboxyl group, proving that the PVP/GTE nanostructures contained water, alcohols, and phenols. The peak at 1040 cm -1 , which is the stretching of C-O group in amino acid, gave another proof to the intermolecular interaction.},

The effect of filler on morphological and mechanical characteristics was studied. Utilization of human cadaver in means of medical study has been commonly used primarily as tools of medical teaching and training such as surgery. Nonetheless, human cadaver brought inevitable problems. So it is necessary to find a substitute material that can be used to replace cadavers. In orthopaedics, the materials that resemble in mechanical properties to biological tissues are elastomers such as natural rubber (latex) and synthetic rubber (polyurethanes, silicones). This substitution material needs to consider the potential of Indonesia to help the development of the nation. Indonesia is the second largest country producer of natural rubber in the world. This paper aims to contribute to adjusting the mechanical properties of tissue-mimicking materials (TMMs) to the recommended range of biological tissue value and thus allow the development of phantoms with greater stability and similarity to human tissues. Repeatability for the phantom fabrication process was also explored. Characteristics were then compared to the control and mechanical characteristics of different human body part tissue. Nanosilica is the best filler to produce the best nanocomposite similarities with human tissue. We produced composites that approaching the properties of human internal tissues.},

Catalyst granules are placed into the cavity of a reactor panel made of glass. A pump is used to circulate wastewater in the photoreactor. Methylene blue (MB) dissolved in water was chosen as the wastewater model. The performance of the photoreactor was evaluated based on changes in MB concentration with respect to time. The photoreactor showed a good performance by degrading 10 L of MB solution up to 96.54\% after 48 h of solar irradiation. The photoreactor was scaled up by enlarging the panel area to twice its original size. The increase in the surface area of the reactor panel and therefore of the mass of catalyst granules and reactor volume led to a three-fold increase of the photodegradation rate. In addition, the MB degradation kinetics were also studied. Data analysis confirmed the applicability of the pseudo-first-order Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The proposed photoreactor has great potential for use in large-scale wastewater treatment.},

To These precursors, silica nanoparticles were added at various concentrations from 0 to 5 \%wt. The emission wavelength produced by the phosphor was varied by varying the fraction mass of the silica that were added to the precursors. The results showed that higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity was produced by the BCNO/SiO 2 with 3 \%wt silica addition.

This layer was used as working electrode in quasi solid dye sensitized solar cell. The solar cell structure is FTO/ZnO/TiO 2 /PGE/Pt/FTO using polymer gel electrolyte (PGE). In polymer gel electrolyte system, hybrid copolymer based on poly-TMSPMA (3-methoxysilyl propyl methacrylate) was used as a matrix to trap ionic liquid. An addition of aluminum as atom dopant also studied to observe the physical properties changes of photoanode related to solar cell performance. AlCl 3 was used as dopant material with the concentrations at 0.5 weight \% and 1.0 weight\% of zinc acetate dehydrate as raw material. Based on our previous result, the existence of Al dopant would decrease the surface roughness of ZnO layer, reduce the grain size of ZnO particles, transmittance at visible light increase and also change the charge carrier density. Nevertheless, the highest efficiency was achieved for undoped ZnO/TiO 2 photoanode (η=0.67\%). Based on current-voltage measurement data analysis (using diode model equation) the ideality factor ( n ) of device using undoped ZnO was smaller ( n =2.96) than AZO 0.5 wt\% and 1.0 wt\% ( n =∼4), indicate better quality of undoped ZnO/TiO 2 interfaces rather than AZO/TiO 2 .},

We found that the liquid-solid phase transition occurs rather gradually, which might be due to the fact that co\_oil consists of many kinds of fatty acids with the largest amount of lauric acid (about 50\%), with relatively small supercooling degree. For this reason, the end of phase transition region become smeared out, although the inflection point in the temperature derivative is clearly observed signifying the drastic temperature variation between the phase transition and solid phase periods. The data have led to the values of mean specific heat of the solid and liquid co\_oil that are comparable to the pure lauric acid, while the value for heat of fusion is resemble to those of the DSC result, both from references data. The advantage of co\_oil as the potential sensible and latent TES for room-temperature conditioning application in Indonesia is discussed in terms of its rather broad working temperature range due to its mixture composition characteristic.},

A different analysis approach as a comparative study have been analyzed based on breeding ratio and heavy metal inventory ratio concepts in fast breeder reactor (FBR) type. Breeding ratio and heavy metal inventory obtain higher than unity which shows breeding gain or surplus inventory of heavy metals are obtained. Breeding ratio indicates the fuel conversion capability from conversion process of fertile materials into fissile material such as fertile materials of U-238, Pu-238, Pu-240 and fissile materials of Pu-239 and Pu-241. Inventory ratio approaches are appropriate to estimate some selected actinide as a mass inventory production such as plutonium inventory ratio which estimate the surplus mass inventory from the ratio of produced plutonium at the net of operation to the initial inventory ratio.},

Some simulations for 800 MWt Pb-208 cooled fast reactors has been performed and the results show that the reactor can anticipate complete pumping failure inherently by reducing power through reactivity feedback and remove the rest of heat through natural circulations.

We present some unique characteristics of gamma spectrometry in various sedimentar and vulcanic rocks of East Java Basins. Details contents of gamma ray spectra give enrichments to characterize sample of sediment and vulcanic in East Java. Weathered vulcanic clay has lower counting rate of gamma ray than alluvial deltaic clay counting rate. Therefore, gamma spectrometrometry can be used as tool for characterizing the enviroment of clay whether vulcanic or alluvial-deltaic.

	abstract = {Indonesia has giant vulcanic arc that almost the largest vulcanic arc in the world. Therefore, one of the main risk for nuclear site plan is the vulcanic area. Therefore to reduce the risk, one of most safety nuclear site plant is old vulcanic area. In this paper, we propose to predict subsurface temperature profile to ensure the condition of subsurface of vulcanic zone. Geothermal heat flow is important parameter in modeling of subsurface temperature. The subsurface temperature is one of vulcanic activity parameter which very important for nuclear site plant risk assesment. The integrated modeling for predicting subsurface temperature profile is carried out by combining geothermal heat flow and subsurface profiles resulted from either seismic or gravity measurement. The finite difference of Fourier’s law is applied to surface temperature, temperature gradient, geothermal heat flow and thermal conductivity profile for producing subsurface temperature distribution accurately. This subsurface temperature profile is essential to characterize the vulcanic zone whether it is still active or inactive. Characterization of vulcanic activity is very useful to ensure or to minimize the risk of nuclear site plant in vulcanic zone. One of interesting case study of nuclear site plan in Indonesia is mount Muriah site plan, this method is useful to ensure whether mount Muriah is still active or inactive now},

	abstract = {For corrosion mitigation of steels used in a fast nuclear reactor power plant, oxygen gas is one of promising candidates of inhibitors. Many experiments have been conducted to reveal the mechanism of corrosion and mechanism of how to overcome the corrosion. In the previous work, we had shown computationally that the oxygen atom can be used to reduce the corrosion and we had predicted the oxygen contents. In the current work, not only to explore deeeper the ability of oxygen gas to reduce the corrosion, but also to include the variation of used temperature. We still used iron material to represent a real steels. Using MD (molecular dynamics) simulation based on the Lennard-Jones interaction potential, we sought to understand the concentration of oxygen gas as variation of temperature used in the reactor for the best corrosion mitigation. From this work, we conclude that the temperature does not give effect in related with how concentration of injected oxygen. The temparature merely affects to rise the diffusion coefficient of iron in liquid lead, yet it does not influence how much oxygen needed for corrosion mitigation. In this work, all simulations on different series of temperatures (1023 ° K, 1073 ° K, 1123 ° K, 1173 ° K) reveals that oxygen content of 0.1151wt\% will cause the lowest corrosion level of iron in liquid lead.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a facile and a fast synthesis process of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is introduced by using a modified Marcano method. A modification of the chemical synthesis method was developed, which uses a small amount of strong acids, a low oxidation temperature and a short stirring process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) spectra confirmed that rGO was successfully synthesized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed rGO in sheet form. Based on energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX), the surface of the prepared rGO sample was dominated by 90\% of C atoms. Four-point probe measurements showed the electrical conductivity of the prepared rGO sample at 1180 S m −1 . Based on the electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) results gives 2.1 Ω charge transfer resistance between the electrode and the electrolyte to the prepared rGO sample. This study provides a new perspective on rGO synthesis using a wet chemical process.},

The time-stamped force-bias Monte Carlo (tfMC) method was used for taking care of the bond switching (BS) rate due to the concentration of carbon atoms in the nickel catalyst. It was found that the hybrid MD/MC method promotes the nickel carbide system to vibrational bond switching. This study also revealed that carbon atoms in metal catalyst are not spread randomly but rather prefer to gather in groups. This phenomenon is not caused by the BS rate only, but also by cohesive–adhesive competition between carbon and nickel atoms.},

The goal of this study was to produce composite fibers with mangosteen extracts as the active ingredient. The mangosteen extract was mixed into PVP solution with thevariousratio (1:0.08, 1:0.10 and 1:0.12) to achieve the best result in term of morphology and antioxidant activity. The morphology and diameter of the fibers were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM image analysis confirmed the formation of bead-free, crystal-free, and aggregate-free fibers hence proving the perfect loading of the mangosteen extract into the PVP fibers. Beside SEM analysis, the fibers also underwent Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis and antioxidant test using DPPH assay. From the FTIR analysis, it has been found that there was aninteraction between the PVP and the extract in the fiber while the DPPH assay test has proven that the extract still retained its antioxidant ability although already being integrated into the fiber.},

In this study, β-carotene was encapsulated into poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/PVP through electrospinning technique in order to protect β-carotene from degradation and to maintain the antioxidant properties. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving β-carotene (1 wt.\%) to various concentrations of PVP (6 wt.\%, 8 wt.\%, 10 wt.\%, and 12 wt.\%) in ethanol. SEM images showed the formation of nanoscale beaded fibers with generally increasing average diameter when the PVP concentration was increased except when the concentration of precursor solution was 12 wt.\% PVP. In this case, it became too viscous and caused clogging on the needle tip and the formation of multi-jets. The average diameters of PVP/β-carotene composite nanofibers were in the range of 176 to 306 nm. The analyses of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra proved the presence of structural changes in PVP nanofibers after being loaded by β-carotene as a result of molecular interaction between β-carotene and PVP. This was given by a significant shift of the peak at 1440 cm-1 to lower wavenumbers of the FTIR spectrum of PVP. The β-carotene was proven to retain their antioxidant ability even after being encapsulated into the PVP nanofibers as tested by the DPPH assay method.},

	abstract = {Nanofiber is one-dimensional material that has broad application. It can be formed by applying a high-voltage source to a polymer solution so that the polymer solution becomes charged. Usingthe high electric field, the charged polymer solution is formed as a Taylor cone and then drawn to the collector to form long, nanoscale fibers. This method is known as electrospinning. There are two types of electrospinning method; they are needle and needleless electrospinning. The latter is intended for mass production nanofibers because it can make tens to hundreds ofjets at a time. Therefore, the high-voltage source required for the needleless electrospinning process must have a higher voltage and current compared to those for the needle one. Accordingly, the high voltage power supply using a series-configuration Mazzilli ZVS flyback converter was designed and developed. The Mazzilli flyback converter was able to generate a high voltage with relatively high power. Two converters were connected in series to achieve more output voltage. The output voltage was adjusted by changing the input voltage. The single converter could generate a high voltage up to 34kV whereas the series-configuration converter could increase the voltage by 98.41\% to be 67kV. The output voltage of converter was relatively stable and good enough to perform nanofibers synthesis using the needleless electrospinning. Visual observation confirmed that the nanofibers were formed well on the collector.},

	abstract = {Rotary forcespinning (RFS) is a simple method of fabricating fibers with a high production rate and low production cost. It can modify fibers morphology by varying polymer concentration, the solution flow rate, and the speed of induction motor. The change in the motor speed affects fibers diameter distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller to maintain the stability of the speed during fibers production. A dimmer circuit to control the AC voltage supplied to the induction motor and a rotary encoder with a signal conditioner to measure the motor speed were used to regulate the motor speed. By applying the second Ziegler-Nichols tuning method, the PID controller constants, which are Kp, Ti, and Td, were obtained; Their values were 0.001242, 5, and 1.25, respectively. From the control system responses for the set points in the range of 16,000 to 28,000 rpm, it was shown that the control system has a fast response. In addition, a maximum overshoot of 345 rpm at the set point of 24,000 rpm and a maximum steady-state error of 335 rpm at the set point of 28,000 rpm were also obtained by the control system. Under a disturbance of 5 s given to the control system, the speed could be restored back to its original state within 34 s. Therefore, the speed regulation system was regarded as a good control system.},

A large number of products start to rely on the advancement of this field, which implies the dependence of several industies on the development of efficient synthesis devices. However, some of the methods that were established earlier possess several drawbacks which potentially outweigh the actual benefits. Therefore, to overcome the problems present in previous systems, a new method utilizing centrifugal force was developed in this research, which is called mini-Rotary Forcespinning. This method is the variant of the previous research which employed a similar machine with a larger scale. While the pre-existing instruments have been adequate to produce fibers, the control mechanism is rather complicated due to the usage of alternating current (AC). In this research, an initial design of the device, which is operable from 3000 rpm to 18000 rpm was established. Within the range, the device performed firmly with 17.4 gram weighing, which is crucial to the stability of the system as a whole. This research paper discusses the schematics and control mechanism, and the possibility of further synthesis operation is predicted.},

	abstract = {Advanced applications of a tilt sensor, such as in disaster management, requires a system to test the performance of a tilt sensor before being applied in the field. Commercially, Ideal Aerosmith developed various models of two- and three-axis positioning and rate table system with high resolution and accuracy. However, the utilization of the system is more suitable for military and aerospace technologies that require very high resolution and accuracy. The system is therefore expensive and not portable. This paper reports the development of simple single-axis motion table system to provide precise position and motion rate for testing a tilt sensor. The system was developed by using a stepper motor in which the direction of the movement can be set by adjusting the encountered electrical current in the motor. The resolution of stepper motor used in the developed system was 0.9o/step, whereas various types of tilt sensors and their applications require a tester system with higher resolution. A gears system was employed to improve the stepper motor resolution used in the developed motion table system. Under a certain design of the gears system, the developed motion table system could achieve a higher resolution of 0.018o/step. It has been found that the relationship between the number of steps of the stepper motor and the rotation angle of the developed motion table system was linear and same for forward and backward steps. Moreover, the developed single-axis motion table system moved consistently for either forward (up) or backward (down) rotations in the range of 0 to 180o as assessed by the accelerometer-based tilt sensor. The developed single-axis motion table system can therefore be used for testing tilt sensor.},

Our results showed that the D w value in the thoracic region was 4.5\% lower than the value of D eff , while the D w value in the head region was 8.6\% higher than the value of D eff . The relationships between diameter ( D eff and D w ) and CTDI vol were distinctive. In the head region, decreasing the patient diameter resulted in a constant CTDI vol due to the tube current modulation (TCM) being off, while in the thoracic region decreasing the patient diameter resulted in a decrease in value of CTDI vol due to TCM being on.

As a part of our chemical and cytotoxic evaluation of the Cryptocarya species, we examined three species of Indonesian Cryptocarya. The sample of the wood of C. konishii hayata was collected from Cibodas Botanical Garden, West Java while the stem bark of C. phoebeopsis and C. cagayanensis were obtained from Sorong, Papua. Our investigation of flavonoid constituents on these species afforded three chalcone compounds i.e. desmethylinfectocaryone (1), infectocaryone (2) and cryptocaryone (3).

To reduce the proliferation resistance level, some barriers were used such as matrial barrier of nuclear fuel based on isotopic composition of even mass number of plutonium isotope. Analysis on nuclear fuel sustainability and actinide production composition based on water-cooled thorium reactor system has been done and all actinide composition are recycled into the reactor as a basic fuel cycle scheme. Some important parameters are evaluated such as doping composition of minor actinide (MA) and volume ratio of moderator to fuel (MFR). Some feasible parameters of breeding gains have been obtained by additional MA doping and some less moderation to fuel ratios (MFR). The system shows that plutonium and MA are obtained low compositions and it obtains some higher productions of even mass plutonium, which is mainly Pu-238 composition, as a control material to protect plutonium to be used as explosive devices.},

The decline in oil prices due to oversupply of oil by oil-producing countries of the world due to the instability of the world economy. Wave of layoffs in Indonesia is a response to the decline in oil prices, this led to the energy and mines portfolios Indonesia feared would not be more advantageous than the portfolio in other countries. In this research, portfolio analysis will be done on energy and mining in Indonesia by using stock price data of energy and mines in the period 26 November 2010 until April 1, 2016. It was found that the results have a wide effect of the market potential is high in the determination of the return on the portfolio energy and mines.

	abstract = {Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods (NRs) were successfully prepared by self-assembly methods using zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine as raw materials. ZnO-NRs were grown on FTO/ZnO seed layer and to enhance dye adsorption it was continued by deposition of titania (TiO 2 ) paste by screen printing method. Deposition time of ZnO-NRs were varied, for 120, 150 and 180 minutes and subsequently stacked with one layer of TiO 2 mesoporous. The resulting heterojunction layers of FTO/ZnO-Nrs/TiO 2 was then applied as a photoanode in quasi-solid dye sensitized solar cell (QS- DSSC) with polymer gel electrolyte (PGE) as a hole conductor. UV-Vis spectrometer was used to investigate the changes of dye adsorption in photoanode with/without inserting titania mesoporous. Characterizations of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction was carried out and the results shows that increasing the deposition time produces a smaller average grain size, diameter and denser layer of ZnO-nanorods. From current-voltage measurement, higher efficiency ( η = 2.53\%) was obtained for 120 min ZnO nanorods with short circuit current density (J sc ) of 2.84 mA/cm 2 and open circuit voltage (V oc ) of 0.7 V. The combination of TiO 2 and ZnO-NRs shows a better performance in solar cells characteristics due to increases of dye adsorption on photoanode and high photogenerated electron transport rate. This work emphasizes an optimum condition of ZnO-NRs in combination with TiO 2 mesoporous as an alternative photoanode in QS-DSSC.},

Copper oxide (CuO) nanostructures were prepared by combining the thermal evaporation with dry oxidation. We select CuO system at different thickness (around 90, 170, and 270 nm) and X-ray diffraction spectra confirms their polycrystalline structure. Scanning electron microscope images show the distinct CuO morphology surface for each sample on which the grain shape is changed and the size is grown with the increasing of the CuO thickness. Fourier-transform infra-red spectra reveals the high penetration depth of oxygen at ∼90 nm thick sample indicated by large Si-O-Si bond intensity. Photo current characterization for each sample is carried out to compare its light sensing properties. We found that the thickness of CuO nanostructure system is related to the sensitivity of device during the light exposure in which thinner samples have better performance. Furthermore different band gap for each CuO sample is predicted from its sensitivity at continuous light exposure. We suggest that the grain boundary and the distinct morphology might promote a unique confined nanostructure effect, resulting in band gap widening. These studies demonstrate a new approach for tunable photonic device efficiency that could be beneficial in reducing energy loss during energy conversion.},

First principles calculation by Density Functional Theory has been performed to study the characteristic of MoS2 electronic structure. Indirect band gap of MoS2 lies between point Γ to Γ-K in first brillouine zone, while the direct bandgap lies in point-K. The indirect band gap became larger while the number of layer decreased due to quantum confinement effect in c axis direction. In monolayer MoS2, the indirect band gap become larger than direct one, band gap properties transitioned from indirect to direct. The unique bandgap properties of MoS2 can lead into better application in energy devices such as solar cell [11], FET [10], and photoluminescence device.},

Accurate prediction of scaling tendency is needed to plan treatment and operating condition during the production from gas field. In this study, we develop mathematical model to predict the scaling tendency in gas production pipes. The model consists of two basic equations: precipitation rate and erosion equation. Precipitation rate is calculated using semi-empirical correlation and erosion is calculated using Salama (2000) equation. Then, a modified parameter of scaling tendency (ST), which is the ratio between net precipitation rate and corrosion rate, is introduced to measure the scaling tendency in each segment of production pipe. From simulation, it was found that the interaction between pressure, temperature and fluid composition affected the scaling tendency at most. However, when sand was introduced in the pipe flow, scale formation occurred at low rate. Every segment of production tubing and pipeline gave different tendency condition.},

The structural and morphological properties of MoS 2 nanoflakes were characterized by SEM, EDS, and XRD, while the high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) with the photon energy of 1.27 to 6.53 eV is used to study its optical characteristics. As the results, SEM data shows that MoS 2 appears to be nanoflakes covering around 25-35\% on the surface of quartz substrate, and XRD spectra shows the dominant orientation along c-axis (002). Based on spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis, the average thickness of MoS 2 nanoflakes is around 12 nm or about 6-8 layers. By using Tauc plot method, we confirm that MoS2 nanoflakes have a semiconductor characteristic with the optical bandgap as high as 1.68 eV. Our study shows the important of structural and optical properties of MoS 2 nanoflakes that can be utilized for future optoelectronic devices and energy-harvesting purposes.},

In this paper we discuss the performance of coconut oil cells as room thermal energy storage. The heat exchange mechanism of coconut oil (CO) which is one of potential organic Phase Change Material (PCM) is studied based on the results of temperature measurements in the perimeter and core parts of cells. We found that the heat exchange performance, i.e. heat absorption and heat release processes of CO cells are dominated by heat conduction in the sensible solid from the higher temperature perimeter part to the lower temperature core part and heat convection during the solid-liquid phase transition and sensible liquid phase. The capability of heat absorption as measured by the reduction of air temperature is not influenced by CO cell size. Besides that, the application of CO as the thermal mass has to be accompanied by air circulation to get the cool sensation of the room’s occupants.},

In fitting process, instead using Drude model, we used the combination of Lorentz model to describe optical properties of metals. The results show that each metal has unique different features of ε 1 and ε 2 in range of far-infrared to vacuum-ultraviolet. Also, the loss by interband transition is observable for some metals. Furthermore, the plasmonic quality-factor, which are related to electric-field enhancement and heat production generated by surface plasmon, of metal nanoparticle have been calculated and we found the optimum region of device application for each metal. From this study, Cu is promising metal working in near-infrared to visible area potentially to substitute noble Ag and Au. On the other hand, Al is the best metal to be applied as plasmonic device working in ultraviolet region. Moreover, enhancement of plasmonic quality-factor by changing geometry and environment of metal is also discussed.

The measurement result show that the J-V characteristic significantly changed with temperature. The J-V curve shows a diode characteristic at room temperature but it changes to an Ohmic characteristic at high temperature.

Beside uranium utilization, it can be used also thorium fuel resources for SMR as a part of optimalization of nuclear fuel as a “partner” fuel with uranium fuel. A small long-life reactor based on thorium fuel cycle for several reactor coolant types and several power output has been evaluated in the present study for 10 years period of reactor operation. Several key parameters are used to evaluate its effect to the reactor performances such as reactor criticality, excess reactivity, reactor burnup achievement and power density profile. Water-cooled types give higher criticality than liquid metal coolants. Liquid metal coolant for fast reactor system gives less criticality especially at beginning of cycle (BOC), which shows liquid metal coolant system obtains almost stable criticality condition. Liquid metal coolants are relatively less excess reactivity to maintain longer reactor operation than water coolants. In addition, liquid metal coolant gives higher achievable burnup than water coolant types as well as higher power density for liquid metal coolants.},

One of the major problems is abundance of agricultural product during the peak of harvest season that is not matched by an increase in demand of agricultural product by consumers, this causes a wasted agricultural products. Alternative way was food preservation by freeze dried method. This method was already using heat transfer through conduction and convection to reduce water quality in the food. The main objective of this research was to design a model heat and mass transfer in freeze-dried medium. We had two steps in this research, the first step was design of medium as the heat injection site and the second was simulate heat and mass transfer of the product. During simulation process, we use physical property of some agriculture product. The result will show how temperature and moisture distribution every second. The method of research use finite element method (FEM) and will be illustrated in three dimensional.},

	abstract = {Corrosion is a critical issue during the development of a gas field, especially wet gas or retrograde gas field. Corrosion affects the management system of a field and further impacts the amount of investment. Therefore, accurate prediction of corrosion rate is needed to plan an effective preventive action before going further to the development phase. One of the important parameters that should be noticed to create an accurate prediction is the formation of the passive layer. In CO 2 -H 2 S environment, there will be three possibilities of passive layer: FeS, FeCO 3 or no passive layer. In this study, we create mathematical models to determine the formed passive layer in each segment of the gas production tubing and pipeline. The model is built using Faraday’s Law and Thermodynamic approach to account the passive layer formation at different temperature, pH, corrosion rate and partial pressure of CO 2 and H 2 S. From the simulation, it was found that there were three boundary conditions: no scale-FeS boundary, no scale-FeCO 3 boundary and FeS-FeCO 3 boundary. The first two boundaries evolved over a time as the concentration of Fe 2+ ions was increasing. However, FeS-FeCO 3 boundary remained steady as it was not affected by the addition of Fe 2 + ions. Using sample case study, few variations were noticed at production pipeline and tubing. It was caused by the gas composition, which contained high CO 2 and very low H 2 S. Boundary conditions only changed slightly over two days period.},

	abstract = {The study of digital rock physics has seen significant advances due to the development of X-ray micro computed tomography scanning devices. One of the advantages of using such a device is that the pore structure of rock can be mapped down to the micrometre level in three dimensions. However, in providing such high-resolution images (low voxel size), the resulting file sizes are necessarily large (of the order of gigabytes). Lower image resolution (high voxel size) produces smaller file sizes (of the order of hundreds of megabytes), but risks losing significant details. This study describes the effect of the image resolution obtained by means of hardware-based and software-based approach. Four samples of porous rock were scanned using a SkyScan 1173 High Energy Micro-CT. We found that acquisition using increased pixel binning of the camera (hardware-based resizing) significantly affects the calculated physical properties of the samples. By contrast, voxel resizing by means of a software-based approach during the reconstruction process yielded less effect on the porosity and specific surface area of the samples. However, the decreasing resolution of the image obtained by both the hardware-based and the software-based approaches affects the permeability significantly. We conclude that simulating fluid flow through the pore space using the Lattice Boltzmann method to calculate the permeability has a significant dependency on the image resolution.},

The ferroelectric–paraelectric transition (Tc {\textasciitilde}800 K for x = 0.2 and {\textasciitilde}765 K for x = 0.4) is well mirrored by the Raman scattering near 60 cm−1 arising from the so-called rigid layer mode. The temperature dependence of the phonon mode near 42 cm−1 arising from A-site Pb/Bi displacements indicates a second structural transformation near 570 K and 400 K for x = 0.2 and 0.4, respectively, similar to that observed for Mn-free PbBi4Ti4O15. This structural alteration resembles a thermodynamically second-order phase transition for all three compounds and the critical temperature (Ta) decreases with the increase in the A-site Bi3+ amount, related to the heterovalent substitution (Mn3+ for Ti4+) on the B site; Ta = 600, 570, 400 K for x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, respectively. The BO6 tilting and bending mode near 220 cm−1 also shows an anomaly at Ta, and, thus, this second structural transformation was attributed to subtle rearrangements of A-site cations accompanied by octahedral BO6 tilting in the perovskite-like blocks.

	abstract = {We theoretically investigate the nonlinear optical response of a heterodimer comprising a semiconductor quantum dot strongly coupled to a metal nanoparticle. The quantum dot is considered as a three-level ladder system with ground, one-exciton, and bi-exction states. As compared to the case of a two-level quantum dot model, adding the third (bi-exciton) state produces fascinating effects in the optical response of the hybrid system. Specifically, we demonstrate that the system may exhibit picosecond and sub-picosecond self-oscillations and quasi-chaotic behaviour under single-frequency continuous wave excitation. An isolated semiconductor quantum dot does not show such features. The effects originate from competing one-exciton and bi-exciton transitions in the semiconductor quantum dot, triggered by the self-action of the quantum dot via the metal nanoparticle. The key parameter that governs the phenomena mentioned is the ratio of the self-action strength and the bi-exciton shift. The self-oscillation regime can be achieved in practice, in particular, in a heterodimer comprised of a closely spaced ZnS/ZnSe core-shell quantum dot and a spherical silver nanoparticle. The results may have applications in nanodevices for generating trains of ultrashort optical pulses.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on the result of a research into the utilisation of a smartphone for the study of magnetostatics on the basis of experiments. The use of such a device gives great measurement result and thus it can replace magnetic sensor tools that are relatively expensive. For the best experimental result, firstly the position of the magnetic sensor in the smartphone has to be considered by way of value mapping of a magnetic field due to permanent magnet. The magnetostatics experiment investigated in this research was the measurement of magnetic field due to electrical currents in two shapes of wire, straight and looped. The current flow, the distance between the observation point and the wire, and the diameter of the loop were the variable parameters investigated to test the smartphone’s capabilities as a measurement tool. To evaluate the experimental results, the measured data were compared with theoretical values that were calculated by using both an analytical and a numerical approach. According to the experiment results, the measured data had good agreement with the results from the analytical and the numerical approach. This means that the use of the magnetic sensor in a smartphone in physics experiments is viable, especially for magnetic field measurement.},

	abstract = {BCNO (boron carbon oxynitride) phosphors have attracted attention due to their non toxicity, simple synthesis process, and high quantum efficiency. However, the tunable emission, particularly a red emission, is still challenging to achieve. In the present study, a bright red emission (emission wavelength 620 nm under 365 nm UV excitation) of a manganese-doped BCNO (BCNO:Mn) phosphor synthesized by a solid state method is reported. Without Mn-doping, the BCNO phosphor exhibited a bright blue emission that can be ascribed to the closed-shell BO− and BO2− anions that act as luminescence center. Via Mn-doping, a red emission was exhibited that can be ascribed to the 4T1(4G) → 6A1(6S) transition from a new luminescence center of Mn2+ incorporated into the BCNO host lattice. The optimum red PL properties (λem: 611 nm, λex: 365 nm) were obtained with BCNO:Mn at a molar ratio of Mn/B at 0.71\% mol/mol synthesized at 550 °C. We believe that the BCNO:Mn is a promising red-emitting phosphor for white light diodes.},

The adsorption is physical as indicated by high adsorption intensity (n{\textgreater}1) and small mean free energy (E{\textless}20kJ/mol). The negative ΔG° (−13.33 to −13.44kJ/mol) indicates the spontaneous nature of adsorption.

We found that plasmon in Pt are responsible to provide transferred electron for electronic blocking of exciton in ZnO film induce by spontaneous recombination from Pt. In the case of Cu doped ZnO film, we confirm screening effects on exciton and a localized interband transition for both systems (ZnO film on Pt and ZnO film on quartz). In Cu-doped ZnO film, electronic blocking of exciton by Pt plasmon is more pronounce rather than screening effect by interband transition.

The amount of copper deposited between TiO2 particles can be controlled by varying the duty cycles and the deposition time. We found that the cell fabricated by the deposition of copper at duty cycles of 60\% and a deposition time of 30s exhibited the highest efficiency (2.21\%). Efficiency was improved to 3.5\% following the post-treatment of the cell with NaOH. We also proposed a simple mathematical model to explain the dependence of the efficiency on the amount of copper. Efficiencies of more than 3\% for solar cells made by a simple method and using inexpensive materials make these solar cells promising competition for the current commercial solar cells.},

The calculation results showed that the adhesive energy of CNTs and clean Al2O3(0001) depends on the diameter of CNTs. The structures of the CNTs adsorbed on Al-terminated Al2O3(0001) do not drastically change from those before adsorbing. C atoms of CNTs interacted with the topmost Al atom of Al2O3(0001) by forming covalent bonding. In the case of the O-terminated Al2O3(0001), small-diameter CNTs have strong interaction, which comes from the opening of CNTs catalytically induced by the O-terminated surface and the subsequent formation of mixed covalent-ionic bonding between C and O atoms. This strong interfacial interaction also leads to significant charge transfer from the CNTs to the O-terminated Al2O3(0001). The strong interfacial interaction of small diameter CNTs with the O-terminated Al2O3(0001) would be a possible mechanism for the successful Al2O3 composite reinforced with CNTs.},

Most α-amylases have been classified in glycoside hydrolase family 13 with a typical (β/α)8-barrel containing two aspartic acid and one glutamic acid residue that play an essential role in catalysis. An atypical α-amylase (BmaN1) with only two of the three invariant catalytic residues present was isolated from Bacillus megaterium strain NL3, a bacterial isolate from a sea anemone of Kakaban landlocked marine lake, Derawan Island, Indonesia. In BmaN1 the third residue, the aspartic acid that acts as the transition state stabilizer, was replaced by a histidine. Three-dimensional structure modeling of the BmaN1 amino acid sequence confirmed the aberrant catalytic triad. Glucose and maltose were found as products of the action of the novel α-amylase on soluble starch, demonstrating that it is active in spite of the peculiar catalytic triad. This novel BmaN1 α-amylase is part of a group of α-amylases that all have this atypical catalytic triad, consisting of aspartic acid, glutamic acid and histidine. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this group of α-amylases comprises a new subfamily of the glycoside hydrolase family 13.},

	abstract = {Microalgae-derived oils have potential as a biofuel feedstock. To produce microalgal oils at a large scale, large amounts of nutrients and energy are needed to grow the algae. In this study, we evaluated three types of agricultural fertilizer (AF)-based culture media (AF1, AF2, and AF3) based on a previously published enriched seawater (ES) medium to produce biomass and oils from Thalassiosira sp. Under laboratory conditions, the highest cell productivity of Thalassiosira sp. was obtained with the AF3 medium. Thalassiosira sp. cultured in the AF3 medium produced 10.4 ± 0.9 mg L−1 day−1oils, which is significantly higher than the 5.8 ± 0.7 mg L−1 day−1produced in the ES medium. The higher production was due to the presence of nitrate and trace elements, both of which played roles in enhancing biomass and oil content, respectively. During cell growth, resting spores appeared inside the cells and were a marker to harvest the cells. Because of the abundant availability of sunlight in the tropics during the year, the oil production of Thalassiosira sp. in the AF3 medium was scaled up using outdoor photobioreactors under different weather conditions (rainy and dry seasons). Thalassiosira sp. produced more unsaturated fatty acids during the rainy season and produced more saturated fatty acids during the dry season. This study also demonstrated that it was possible to culture Thalassiosira sp. under outdoor conditions using a low-cost agricultural fertilizer-based culture medium (AF3 medium) to produce biodiesel feedstock with an annual production of 8.1 ± 0.4 t ha−1 during the dry season and of 23.9 ± 6.8 t ha−1 during the rainy season.},

To ensure that a good balance between nonlinearity and dispersion is accommodated by the scheme, the propagation of a solitary wave (undisturbed in shape) was simulated. Our next focus was on the simulation of transient waves generated by bottom motion. After conducting a benchmark test against Hammack’s experimental results for downward bottom motion, an anti-symmetric bottom thrust was considered. The resulting transient waves developed different behavior depending on the water depth. Finally, to mimic the December 2004 tsunami, a seabed motion was generated over Aceh bathymetry. This simulation showed that a package of wave trains developed and propagated towards the Aceh coast, and exhibited inter alia the feature of shoreline withdrawal often observed.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model of micro-finance investment using profit-loss sharing scheme are made and implemented to simulated data. Here profits from the venture will be shared in a portion between the investor and the entity running the business. The scheme can be classified as Musharaka type of investment in Sharia economy. The proposed model is theoretically implemented with data from small-scale traders at a local traditional market who have small turnover. They are common target of usurers who lend money with high interest rate and penalties. If the traders are in unfortunate conditions, they are potentially in poorer condition than before committing themselves to the usurer. In the conventional practices of the profit sharing scheme, the investor will get a fixed portion of the trader’s income, which is applied for all kind of small-scale traders. If the traders are diligent and hard worker and have very high turnover, then the investor will gain much more profit whether the contributed capital is small or large. In this paper, the scheme is implemented using Semi-Fuzzy Logic Approach so that the profit-loss sharing scheme can achieve its intended goal, which is to make a profitable investment not only for the investor but also for traders. The approach is not fully using Fuzzy Logic because some variables are still in crisp numbers and the optimization problem is regular in the form of crisp numbers. Based on the existing data, the results show that the optimal profit share is depended on the income of the traders. The higher the income coming from the venture, the lesser the profit share for the investor which is reasonable with the fixed initial contributed capital. Keywords: Profit-Loss Sharing, Fuzzy logic, Musharaka, Optimization, Mathematical modelJEL Classification: C61, D60},

The conversion of allyl phenyl ether (neat) in H-ZSM-5 was 67\% which produced 40\% of 2-allylphenol, 17\% of 2-methyldihydrobenzofuran, and other product (4:1.7:1), while in Na-ZSM-5 produced exclusively 2-allylphenol with 52\% conversion. These results showed that zeolite properties can be tuned to give a selective transformation by substitution of metal ion into the zeolite interior.},

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy shows the amorphous structure of RT growth of ZnO thin films in contrast to relatively good crystallinity of ZnO film grown at 260°C. I-V characteristics of reverse-forward bias of UV photodetector were taken in dark and light conditions. As the results, amorphous phase of RT ZnO shows the high value of dark current and photocurrent. High stability of photo detection is also observable over the specific time as investigated by switching condition. In addition, we found that the mechanism of photo detection is strongly related to the oxygen adsorption on the ZnO surface.

The pure ZnO and ZnO:3\%Ti (TZO) films were deposited on Si substrates by using DC-unbalanced magnetron sputtering. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the TZO film grows more homogeneously in comparison with the pure ZnO structure. We suggest that Ti dopants play a role in uniformly distributing ZnO elements from the sputtering target to the Si substrate. The transmittance spectra of the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy show a peak splitting of Zn–O stretching in the TZO film, which is also related to the dopant-modified film morphology. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra show that the Ti dopants also change the main ZnO crystal orientation from (0 0 2) to (1 0 3). The ZnO and TZO film-based photodetectors were fabricated by using a metal–semiconductor–metal planar configuration with Ag as the metal contact. Based on the I–V characteristics, Ti doping in the ZnO system reduces the dark current and induces the enhancement of the photo-to-dark-current ratio. Our study shows the important role of Ti doping on the improvement of photodetection performance.},

	abstract = {A combined computational and experimental study has been performed to investigate the best carbazole dyes for iodide- and cobalt-based DSSCs. TDDFT calculations have been implemented to figure out the electronic properties of three kinds of carbazole dyes, namely SD4, JM1 and JM2. These carbazole dyes have similar structures and their main difference lies on the position of their alkyl chain substituent. The calculated absorbance-spectra of the three dyes in the UV–visible range are in good agreement with the experimental results. The HOMO–LUMO analysis reveals that the SD4 dye has a better charge separation and a LUMO position slightly higher compared to the others. Calculations have been carried out to quantify the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT). The result shows that JM2 has the highest qCT but unfortunately accompanied by a short dCT which indicates that the opportunity of electron recombination is high in JM2. The computational results also indicate that SD4 is the most promising candidate as a sensitizer in DSSC compared to JM1 and JM2. These results are in agreement with our experimental test using iodide-based electrolyte. On the other hand, the experiments show that JM2, which has two hexyl chains located in the edge of molecule, has the best performance when coupled with cobalt-based electrolyte.},

Dimethyl sulfoxide was used to dissolve each curcumin analog compound, and then diluted with biological buffer. They were then mixed with CA-II solution and to start the reaction, 4-NPA was added. Hydrolysis of the substrate was evaluated at 405 nm after incubation for 2 h at 25 °C. The IC50 value of compounds with inhibitory activity higher than 40 \% was then evaluated. Molecular docking was also used to predict enzymeinhibitor interaction.Results: Eight new curcumin analogs were potent to inhibit CA-II activity with IC50 values ranging from 7.92 ± 0.54 to 72.31 ± 2.21 μmol; the lowest value was exhibited by (3E,5E)-3,5-bis[(2- hydroxyphenyl)methylidene]piperidin-4-one (a1). Molecular docking analysis revealed that this molecule formed hydrogen bonds with Thr199, Thr200 and Gln92 at the active site of CA-II.Conclusion: These curcumin analogs have inhibitory potential against CA-II; (3E, 5E)-3,5-bis[(2- hydroxyphenyl)methylidene]piperidin-4-one (a1) has the highest inhibitory activity and may be useful in the development of CA-II inhibitors for glaucoma treatment.Keywords: Carbonic anhydrase II inhibitor, Curcumin analogs, Molecular docking},

	abstract = {Nanofiber mats of polyvinyl(pyrrolidone) (PVP) with Garcinia mangostana extract (GME) as the encapsulated drug have been developed using electrospinning. SEM images of all electrospun PVP/GME composite nanofiber mats showed that they had similar and smooth morphology, no beads, and spindle shape. Its average diameter decreased and its surface area therefore increased with the decrease of its PVP concentration. The benefit of high surface area is obvious in drug delivery systems for poorly water-soluble drugs. Their FTIR spectra indicated that PVP and GME interacted intermolecularly via hydrogen bonds in the composite nanofiber mats. A conformational change in the C-H chain of PVP occurred in the composite nanofiber mats due to the intermolecular interactions. Their XRD patterns confirmed that they were amorphous because of amorphization during electrospinning. The XRD analyses also strengthened the FTIR studies; namely, GME and PVP formed intermolecular interactions in the electrospun composite nanofiber mats. As a result, GME as the encapsulated drug was molecularly dispersed in the electrospun PVP nanofiber matrix that functioned as a drug delivery system. From the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, the composite nanofiber mats exhibited very high antioxidant activities despite having been exposed to high voltage during electrospinning. Therefore, they are potential antioxidant products for food and pharmaceutics.},

Nano-silica is an inorganic compound with a surface area of 200 m2/g, and it has a hygroscopic property so that the presence of nano-silica in membrane can increase properties of membrane. The SPS-LS-SO2 membranes were prepared by casting polymer solution and membranes were characterized by functional groups analysis, water uptake, ion exchange capacity (IEC), proton conductivity, methanol permeability, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and surface morphology. The results show the increase of nano-silica composition in SPS-LS-SiO2 membranes, the IEC, water uptake, proton conductivity increase, but a pore size of membrane decreases. On the other hand, it can maintain the mechanical strength of membranes. The SPS-LS-SiO2 membranes with nano-silica composition of 2\%–5\% (w/w) have the same properties with Nafion®117, especially in proton conductivity at the same treatment and measurement conditions, and its methanol permeability is about 28\%–35\% smaller than that of Nafion®117 (2.09 × 10−6 cm2/s), so this SPS-LS-SiO2 membrane could be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) application.},

The resistivity of the heat-treated particle was as low as 0.04 Ω.cm, with a specific surface area of 52.9 m2 g−1. The effects of heat-treatment on changes in the crystal structure and their correlation with the electron conductivity are discussed based on transmission electron microscopy images, X-ray diffraction spectra, and X-ray adsorption fine structure spectra.

We investigated axial images of 75 patients who underwent CT examinations. Truncated axial images were characterized by the truncation percentage (TP). Correction factors were calculated by using the value of DW for a certain TP (truncated image) divided by the value of DW for TP = 0\% (the non-truncated image). Most of the thorax images acquired for this study were truncated images (86.2\%), in the abdomen region about half of the images were truncated (48.1\%), and in the head region only a small portion were truncated (9.1\%). In the thorax region the value of TP for the truncated images varied up to 50\%, in the abdomen region it varied up to 35\%, and in the head region it was smaller than 10\%. We have shown how to accurately estimate DW and SSDE by applying a correction factor to the truncated images. The correction factors increase exponentially with increasing TP.

The ionic diffusion coefficients of these PGEs are smaller than those of the pure ionic liquid, which may explain the observation of decreased cell performances in the DSSCs using these PGEs. However, from more detailed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies, there is a strong evidence that the cell performance is also limited by inefficient charge transfer and charge transport inside the mesoporous TiO2 layer. This is indicated by the absence of transmission line characteristics in the observed Nyquist plots. The present experimental results then indicate that the lack of electrolyte penetration into the mesoporous TiO2 layer, due to the PGE rheology behavior caused by the siloxane-based polymer gel used here, is another crucial limiting factor for the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs using this kind of PGE. We consider that this kind of gel phase effect may be also observed in DSSCs using other types of gel electrolytes, including polyionic liquids.},

These images were interpreted to classify the LULC in a particular area at a certain period. However, the process of visual interpretation might produce a pattern of land class change that does not match actual condition because it always has the potential to create different classification outcomes if compared using image data of higher resolution. Thus, it becomes highly important to verify satellite image data of the study area by generating an index of LULC change.
In this research, proportional stratified random sampling method was used. In this method, each sample of recorded LULC change was verified using a high-resolution image. The verification results were then tested using one-tailed t-test with 90\% confidence level. The product was an index of LULC Change where 1 (the number one) signified that change did/might happen and 0 (the number zero) signified that change did/might not happen.
From this research, LULC Change index with a resolution of 30 meters for the area of West Java Province was obtained. Cellular Autamata-Markov Chain model was used to test the application of this index to predict land cover in 2015. The most accurate result (accurate value = 40.3797\%) was obtained from using Von Neuman nearest neighbors method with 7x7 size.

	abstract = {An extracellular lipase from Psedoxanthomonas sp. was purified 47.3 folds with an overall yield of 27\% through purification procedure of acetone precipitation, ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Protein precipitation using acetone fractionation showed that the enzyme was precipitated at the fraction of 0 to 40\%. Further purification of the enzyme by ion exchange followed by gel filtration chromatography showed that there were two types of lipases with similar molecular size at around 50 kDa. Characterization of optimum pH, temperature, and substrate specificity were carried out against the isolated lipase. Lip1 showed specific substrate preferences towards p-nitro phenyl myristate meanwhile Lip2 exhibited hydrolytic activity towards short and medium acyl chain of the substrate. Further analysis of both enzyme activities on variation of pH and temperature showed that the optimum pH and temperature for Lip1 were at pH 10.0 and 70\&deg;C, respectively while pH 8.0 and 50\&deg;C were the optimum pH and temperature for Lip2 respectively. Lyophilized lipase isolated from acetone fraction showed lipolytic activity under variation of methanol concentration up to 30\%.

	abstract = {The future of fuel cells that convert chemical energy to electricity relies mostly on the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to its sluggish kinetics. By effectively bypassing the use of organic surfactants, the postsynthesis steps for immobilization onto electrodes, catalytic ink preparation using binders, and the common problem of nanoparticles (NPs) detachment from the supports involved in traditional methodologies, we demonstrate a versatile electrodeposition method for growing anisotropic microstructures directly onto a three-dimensional (3D) carbon felt electrode, using platinum NPs as the elementary building blocks. The as-synthesized materials were extensively characterized by integrating methods of physical (thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and electroanalytical (voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrometry) chemistry to examine the intricate relationship of material-to-performance and select the best-performing electrocatalyst to be applied in the model reaction of ORR for its practical integration into a microbial fuel cell (MFC). A tightly optimized procedure enables decorating an electrochemically activated carbon felt electrode by 40–60 nm ultrathin 3D-interconnected platinum nanoarrays leading to a hierarchical framework of ca. 500 nm. Half-cell reactions reveal that the highly rough metallic surface exhibits improved activity and stability toward ORR (Eonset ∼ 1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, p(HO2–) {\textless} 0.1\%) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (−10 mA cm–2 for only 75 mV overpotential). Owing to its unique features, the developed material showed distinguished performance as an air-breathing cathode in a garden compost MFC, exhibiting better current and faster power generation than those of its equivalent classical double chamber. The enhanced performance of the material obtained herein is explained by the absence of any organic surfactants on the surface of the nanoarrays, the good metal–support interaction, particular morphology of the nanoarrays, and the reduced aggregation/detachment of particles. It promises a radical improvement in current surface reactions and paves a new way toward electrodes with regulated surface roughness, allowing for their successful application in heterogeneous catalysis.},

The unbalanced precursor molarity approach, where the molarity of one precursor (LiOH) is several times larger than the molarity represented by a chemical reaction balance, was used. The blue luminescence, which was accompanied by an enhancement of luminescence intensity, was observed at very high LiOH concentrations. This was probably due to the simultaneous reduction in the crystalline size and improvement in the crystallinity. Doping ZnO nanoparticles with europium also generated a red luminescence at 616 nm, due to the 5D0 →7F2 transition of Eu ions.},

This is a laboratory research method conducted using SLS surfactant of bagasse injection process with that of light crude oil. The core injection was reinforced by the tested SLS surfactant characteristics such as IFT and contact angle. The core injection using SLS surfactant showed a high recovery factor at the two areas, at 5000 ppm salinity and at salinity of 80,000 ppm. At a higher salinity level, it produced a larger contact angle of 20°–50°. The interfacial tension value also increased from 2.73 to 4.11 mN/m. The value of oil recovery at these salinity variations ranged from 9.25 to 1.80\%. The results of this research show that the mechanism of surfactant flooding depends on several parameters, like salinity, surfactant concentration, IFT and contact angle. The value of the formed contact angle also affects the performance of SLS surfactant in the oil purification process. Thus, it can be concluded that the parameters of the SLS surfactant in the injection process provide a synergetic effect on the oil recovery mechanism in terms of salinity, surfactant concentration, IFT, and contact angle.},

	abstract = {The immobilization of lipases is often used in biotechnology to improve the performance, reusability, and stability of the enzyme. Candida antarctica lipase B (Cal-B) has been used as a catalyst in trans-esterification reaction. To improve the utilization of Cal-B, therefore the immobilization of Cal-B onto a polymer matrix became crucial. In this study, polyethersulfone (PES) and sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) membranes were used as matrices of Cal-B immobilization. SPES was previously synthesized by modifying PES using chlorosulfonic acid (ClSO3H) to improve the immobilization of Cal-B. SPES-PSf (polysulfone) blended membranes were also successfully prepared by blending SPES, PSf, and PEG in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent using phase-inversion method. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR)–FTIR spectrum showed characteristic peaks of the immobilized Cal-B on the matrix at peak 3184.03 cm−1 (–N–H bonds) and 1683.49 cm−1 (–CH deformation bonds). The Raman spectroscopy of the PES-based membranes before and after sulfonation reaction showed the deviations from the symmetrical structure of PES, with specific Raman shifts at 784.11 cm−1, 1150.95 cm−1, and 1588.9 cm−1. Cal-B was successfully immobilized and loaded onto SPES membrane. By Lowry assay, it was detected that 140.3 μg/cm2 enzyme was successfully loaded into the 17.3 cm2 of membrane. The value was one and a half times higher than PES (91.0 μg/cm2 in 17.3 cm2). However, the hydrolytic activity of Cal-B immobilized onto SPES membrane (17.0 p-NP/min/cm2) was five times lower than Cal-B immobilized onto PES membrane (80.4 p-NP/min/cm2).},

The synthesis was accomplished by acid-catalyzed condensation of naphthobipyrrole building blocks with aromatic aldehydes. The naphthobipyrrole building blocks were synthesized by simple oxidative coupling of the corresponding pyrrole substituted aromatics. Solid-state structural analyses of the synthesized naphthorosarins revealed that the presence of meso-2,6-dichlorophenyl- and 5,6-difluoro-substitution substantially alter the geometry and properties of the naphthorosarins. The substituents affect the redox potentials as well and, in turn, the proton-coupled electron-transfer processes leading to the formation of one- and two-electron reduced forms of the corresponding naphthorosarins. One particular naphthorosarin that bears both peripheral fluorine and meso-2,6-dichlorophenyl substituents forms a stable 25 π-electron species upon treating with TFA that was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The current study underscores how structural modifications can be used to fine-tune the electronic features of naphthorosarins, including stabilization of odd electron species.},

The essential oil from cloves can contain up to 90\% eugenol, which is mainly responsible for its aroma. Eugenol is an interesting compound due to its simplicity and richness in functionalities, making it a valuable building block in synthesis. One of the key steps in eugenol transformation is demethylation to produce a hydroxycavicol. Demethylation is commonly carried out using a nucleophilic or an acidic method. In this study, a simple yet reliable nucleophilic method for demethylation using lithium chloride (LiCl) was attempted. The product was characterized by NMR, FTIR and HRMS spectroscopy. The absence of a methoxy signal at 3.5-4 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum suggests that demethylation was successful. The HRMS result showed m/z 149.0596, confirming the formation of product. The demethylation reaction under acidic conditions formed a dimer of eugenol with the methoxy group still intact. This was supported by the 1H NMR data, which showed methoxy signals at 3.85 and 3.82 ppm and integration in the aromatic region, which suggests a dimer structure.},
